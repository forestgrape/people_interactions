# Thoughts on Migration

> 24.10.23:
> * 'Brainstorming' like and thus *unfinished, to improve and to clarify.*
> * Currently online as [considered] an improvement to a prior version originally published on the [Governance and Self Determination](./governance_and_self_determination.md)*
> * likely biased.


> Both humanitarian and voluntary migration are advocated in a reasonable and ordered way.



> The approach here in general and to move towards a more reasonable and ordered migration scheme is forward looking. In this sense it is opted for 
> * Everyone should have a secure and good place to live. No one should be expelled or have to take dangerous and/or expensive journeys to find refuge/migrate.
>   * Peace should be a priority. Laws and systems should promote peace.
>   * *Refuge places with human rights guaranteed should be available for everybody anytime.* A possibility are UN governed centers spread across the world.
>   * To migrate long distances locally handed permits/visas for work/asylum/study are advocated.
> * All people who lived for several years in a region should be allowed to stay and integrated into the country and its legal and social [support] frameworks (Especially as in many regions including Europe stays without 'official' permit have been 'customary law'/accepted for long.) - 'amnesty' like residence permits could be an option, possibly in exchange with somewhat increased taxes/reduced social support and/or mandatory language courses and/or some time civil service (increased taxes & civil services are already common in many countries for exemptions from mandatory military services).

> Forced or pushed migration (including deportations) are opposed. Regarding deportations as rare exceptions are considered when convicted for serious crimes and a change of country increases or at least not decreases security. Also, a repatriation timely after arrival when there is no legal basis to stay is considered different from a deportation of someone who stayed for several years.


#### Humanitarian Migration
Ideally everyone has safe, legal and affordable pathways to secure and adequate places. If needed handing out visas and travel tickets at embassies in the country itself or neighboring countries/refuge camps.

> >In the last decades regional humanitarian migration often worked within Europe. For example most Ukrainian women and children fortunately have safe passage to and legal stay in many European countries. // Men while eligible for asylum, have no safe passage as they are not allowed to leave Ukraine as the government wants them to be available for conscription [the topic is considered worth a discussion]. 
>> * If the war in Ukraine escalates not all in countries, both west and east of Ukraine, safety is guaranteed, thus in this case it is understandable and not unreasonable if people go further for safety reasons. 
-->
> For migration to places fare away such as cross continent migration often humanitarian and voluntary (often economic reasons) migration are mixed, for this cases the rules were not primarily designed and often not work as intended.
>> Law and lawful behavior is advocated here. When circumventing law is widespread, law can and should be adapted: Law, especially humanitarian law, should be designed to protect those who need it most, be reasonable and encourage 'wanted' behavior. 
<!--
* When some earning a lot of money from 'humanitarian' migration (for example smugglers and money lenders who finance smugglers fees) then there is a risk of prolonging or even encouraging human right abuses, conflicts and wars.

#### Voluntary Migration
> Legal pathways, especially regional, for migration and work, training & education exchanges are considered beneficial. 
>> Within the European Union and associated countries, voluntary migration is frequent and embedded in a legal framework with free movement agreements - generally it seems to work well though some downsides are observed such as emigration including brain-drain from countries with less competitive salaries whereas countries with high salaries and low taxes have a high inflow migration (especially if there is a low language-barrier as it was the case for UK).

> For example, between Europe and Africa both continents could benefit especially in science, craftsmanship and culture. Between EU/EFTA countries and CIS countries increased interactions of people (and not just interactions at the establishment level or a mere transfer of goods such as gas, oil and cars as it has been done) could help to understand each other other and thereby help to prevent future conflicts.
