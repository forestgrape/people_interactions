## Introduction
Whether and if yes under which circumstances a people have the right to secede from a parent country and against the will of the latter is a controversial topic in international law. [*The Normative Status of Self-Determination in International Law: A Formula for Uncertainty in the Scope and Content of the Right?*](#saul-2011) by Matthew Saul considers different viewpoints by states and scholars.

> The opinion advocated here ([Advocated Path for Self Determination](#advocated-path-for-self-determination):
> * is to establish autonomy including self determined government.
> * keeping local people out of geopolitics.
> * no forceful measures against the local people.
> * clearer specification of self determination in international law.

> Some interesting points though not all consideration are agreed here. One is when formulating laws for secession, it can prevent or endanger a path of [granting] autonomy. Another is to determine the right of secession, instead of a backward looking approach (i.e. was the right for self determination violated and were there human right violations?), here a forward looking approach is preferred: How a peaceful and feasible future (for which events in the past may have to be taken into account) in agreement with human rights and self determination is achieved ([Preferred Path for Self Determination](#advocated-path-for-self-determination)).

## Advocated Path for Self Determination

### No Force against the Local People
In general, any kind of forcible methods against [the will of] the local population by *any* party are not considered adequate.

### Local Self Determination
Here to achieve self-determination and living in a setting taking into account local peculiarities, a federalist government structure with local autonomy including a local government determined by the local people, fair and proportional participation in the senior state and respect for the local culture and language is favored over border changes/secession. 

Reasons for autonomy based paths: 
* The world moves closer together:
  * Driven by improvements in communication and transportation, the cooperation between states increases. In support borders are becoming less strict. 
  * Technologies are more and more so powerful, world-wide effects are possible - solutions of such challenges and risks or usage of the chances often benefit from a world-wide cooperations and agreements.
* Multicultural countries have many benefits:
 * More efficient as the strengths of different cultures can be combined.
    > * This does *not* mean a uniform society is bad when it developed like this, however it is also not wish-worthy to achieve or to keep when history means different. // What is a uniform and what is divers, is relative anyways. Once artificial life is alive or aliens turn up, what is considered divers likely changes.
    > * This only works, when there is respect [for one another]. // When subgroups (whether small or large) put group membership above respect and society and team up to against non-group members, society may break [into pieces]. 
    > * Law is advocated here, this includes migration. When there is need for illegal migration, laws can and should be adapted. // Laws should be designed to protect those who need it most, be reasonable and to encourage 'wanted' behavior.
 * Cultural spaces across countries increase interstate interactions and can help understanding & interstate friendships.
    > In Europe, Switzerland managed to stay out of both world wars. While neutrality possibly was a factor, likely the shared cultural space with all neighbors, namely France, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Italy helped.
* *Peace.*
