> Some interesting points though not all consideration are agreed here. One is when formulating laws for secession, it can prevent or endanger a path of [granting] autonomy. Another is to determine the right of secession, instead of a backward looking approach (i.e. was the right for self determination violated and were there human right violations?), here a forward looking approach is preferred: How a peaceful and feasible future (for which events in the past may have to be taken into account) in agreement with human rights and self determination is achieved ([Preferred Path for Self Determination](#advocated-path-for-self-determination)).

## Case Consideration
[in work]






## Advocated Path for Self Determination
Here to achieve self-determination and living in a setting taking into account local peculiarities, a federalist government structure with local autonomy, fair and proportional participation in the senior state and respect for the local culture and language is favored over border changes/secession. 
Reasons are: 
* The world moves closer together:
  * Driven by improvements in communication and transportation, the cooperation between states increases. In support borders are becoming less strict. 
  * Technologies are more and more so powerful, world-wide effects are possible - solutions of such challenges and risks or usage of the chances often benefit from a world-wide cooperations and agreements.
* Multicultural countries have many benefits:
 * More efficient as the strengths of different cultures can be combined.
    > This only works, when there is respect for one another. 
    >> Regarding migration: It is considered important that the locally established culture and customs are respected. Law is advocated here, this includes migration. 
    >>> Laws should be designed to protect those who need it most, be reasonable and to encourage 'wanted' behavior.
 * Cultural spaces across countries increase interstate interactions and can help understanding & interstate friendships.
    > In Europe, Switzerland managed to stay out of both world wars. While neutrality was a factor, likely the shared cultural space with all neighbors, namely France, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Italy helped.
