## Introduction
Whether and if yes under which circumstances a people have the right to secede from a parent country and against the will of the latter is a controversial topic in international law. In  [*The Normative Status of Self-Determination in International Law: A Formula for Uncertainty in the Scope and Content of the Right?*](#saul-2011) by Matthew Saul considers different viewpoints by states and scholars.

> The opinion advocated here:
> * autonomy including self determined government.
> * keeping local people out of geopolitics.
> * no forceful measures

## Self Determination in International Law

> Self-determination including [regional] autonomy and the right for secession is ideally [clearer] specified. Then autonomy questions for regions all across the world can be handled according to specified principles. How the UK allows Scotland to decide itself is considered exemplary, however it is acknowledged that the situation is more complex in other settings when a more central/connecting part wants to secede (for example in Switzerland in 1848, some of the central Cantons wanted to form a 'Sonderbund', which was then prevented by the other cantons).

> Some interesting points though not all consideration are agreed here. One is when formulating laws for secession, it can prevent or endanger a path of [granting] autonomy. Another is to determine the right of secession, instead of a backward looking approach (i.e. was the right for self determination violated and were there human right violations?), here a forward looking approach is preferred: How a peaceful and feasible future (for which events in the past may have to be taken into account) in agreement with human rights and self determination is achieved ([Preferred Path for Self Determination](#advocated-path-for-self-determination)).

## Appendix
### Notes on Migration
> possibly will be moved to an other/separate page.

> Both humanitarian and voluntary migration are supported in a reasonable and ordered way. 
> * Humanitarian Migration: Ideally safe, legal and affordable pathways to secure places ideally close by and if needed handing out visas and travel tickets at embassies in the country itself or neighboring countries/refuge camps. // In the last decades often worked within Europe. For example most Ukrainian women and children fortunately have safe passage to and legal stay in many European countries (if the war in Ukraine escalates not all in countries, both west and east of Ukraine, safety is guaranteed, thus in this case it is understandable and not unreasonable if people go further for safety reasons.). But in general, for migration to places fare away such as cross continent migration often humanitarian and voluntary migration are mixed, for this cases the rules were not primarily designed and often not work as intended.
> * Voluntary Migration: Legal pathways with mutual benefits for all concerned. In Europe, voluntary migration works in general well within the European Union and associated countries. Regionally and even between all continents - Africa, Asia, Australia, Asia and Americas - increased legal possibilities for work, training and education exchanges are considered beneficial. For example, between Europe and Africa both continents could benefit especially in science, craftsmanship and culture. Between EU/EFTA countries and CIS countries increased interactions of many people (and not just interactions of the establishment level or a mere transfer of goods such as gas, oil and cars as it has been done) could help to understand each other other.




### Advocated Path for Self Determination

#### No Force against the Local People
Forcible methods of any kind against [the will of] the local population by *any* party are not considered adequate.

#### Local Self Determination
Here to achieve self-determination and living in a setting which takes local peculiarities into account, a federalist government structure is advocated: Local autonomy including a local government determined by the local people, fair participation in the senior state and respect for the local culture and language. Possibly independent 'regional' sport teams e.g. for football if wished, it works in the UK.

Reasons for autonomy based paths: 
* The world moves closer together:
  * Driven by improvements in communication and transportation, the cooperation and in between states increases. In support borders are becoming less strict. 
  * Technologies are more and more so powerful, world-wide effects are possible - solutions of such challenges and risks or usage of the chances often benefit from a world-wide cooperations and agreements.
* Multicultural countries have many benefits:
   * More efficient as the strengths of different cultures can be combined.
    > * This does *not* mean a uniform society is bad when it developed like this, however it is also not wish-worthy to achieve or to keep when history flows different. // What is uniform, is relative and depends on the features considered: For example Kenya is very divers in languages ([Languages in Kenya](#refs-languages-in-kenya)) and the North America diverse in the origin of the last generations of ancestors which are from most parts of the world. // Everybody likely has ancestors who once lived in the lands of todays Kenya (archeological findings are e.g. described at <https://humanorigins.si.edu/research/east-african-research-projects/olorgesailie-kenya>).
    > * This only works, when there is respect [for one another]. // When subgroups (whether small or large) put group membership above respect, society or even human rights and team up to against non-group members, society may break [into pieces].
    > * Law and lawful behavior is advocated here, this includes [migration](#notes-on-migration). When there is need for widespread behavior against the current law, laws can and should be adapted. // Laws should be designed to protect those who need it most, be reasonable and encourage 'wanted' behavior.
   * Cultural spaces across countries increase interstate interactions and can help understanding & interstate friendships.
    > In Europe, Switzerland managed to stay out of both world wars. While neutrality may have been a factor, likely the shared cultural space with all neighbors, namely France, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Italy helped.
* *Peace.*
