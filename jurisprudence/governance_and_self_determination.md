## Introduction
Whether and if yes under which circumstances a people have the right to secede from a parent country and against the will of the latter is a controversial topic in international law. [*The Normative Status of Self-Determination in International Law: A Formula for Uncertainty in the Scope and Content of the Right?*](#saul-2011) by Matthew Saul considers different viewpoints by states and scholars.

> The opinion advocated here ([Advocated Path for Self Determination](#advocated-path-for-self-determination):
> * is to establish autonomy including self determined government.
> * keeping local people out of geopolitics.
> * no forceful measures against the local people.
> * clearer specification of self determination in international law.

> Self-determination including [regional] autonomy and the right for secession is ideally [clearer] specified. Then autonomy questions for regions all across the world can be handled according to specified principles. How the UK allows Scotland to decide itself is considered exemplary, however it is acknowledged that the situation is more complex in other settings when a more central part wants to secede (for example in Switzerland in 1848, some of the central Cantons wanted to form a 'Sonderbund', which was then prevented by the other cantons). In many cases a solution could be the right for a self determined local government with large economic and political freedom and possibly independent 'regional' sport teams e.g. for football if wished, the UK shows it works. // Though the gain of local identification and the chances to play can come at some cost in competitiveness.

> Some interesting points though not all consideration are agreed here. One is when formulating laws for secession, it can prevent or endanger a path of [granting] autonomy. Another is to determine the right of secession, instead of a backward looking approach (i.e. was the right for self determination violated and were there human right violations?), here a forward looking approach is preferred: How a peaceful and feasible future (for which events in the past may have to be taken into account) in agreement with human rights and self determination is achieved ([Preferred Path for Self Determination](#advocated-path-for-self-determination)).

## Advocated Path for Self Determination

### No Force against the Local People
Forcible methods of any kind against [the will of] the local population by *any* party are not considered adequate.

### Local Self Determination
Here to achieve self-determination and living in a setting which takes local peculiarities into account, a federalist government structure is advocated: Local autonomy including a local government determined by the local people, fair participation in the senior state and respect for the local culture and language.

Reasons for autonomy based paths: 
* The world moves closer together:
  * Driven by improvements in communication and transportation, the cooperation and in between states increases. In support borders are becoming less strict. 
  * Technologies are more and more so powerful, world-wide effects are possible - solutions of such challenges and risks or usage of the chances often benefit from a world-wide cooperations and agreements.
* Multicultural countries have many benefits:
 * More efficient as the strengths of different cultures can be combined.
    > * This does *not* mean a uniform society is bad when it developed like this, however it is also not wish-worthy to achieve or to keep when history flows different. // What is a uniform, is relative and depends on the features considered anyways. Kenya and the US can be both considered as homogenous and divers countries, Kenya in languages and the US with people having their ancestors all across the world. <!--Once artificial life is alive or aliens turn up, what is considered divers likely changes.-->
    > * This only works, when there is respect [for one another]. // When subgroups (whether small or large) put group membership above respect and society and team up to against non-group members, society may break [into pieces]. 
    > * Law is advocated here, this includes migration. When there is need for illegal migration, laws can and should be adapted. // Laws should be designed to protect those who need it most, be reasonable and encourage 'wanted' behavior.
 * Cultural spaces across countries increase interstate interactions and can help understanding & interstate friendships.
    > In Europe, Switzerland managed to stay out of both world wars. While neutrality may have been a factor, likely the shared cultural space with all neighbors, namely France, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Italy helped.
* *Peace.*
