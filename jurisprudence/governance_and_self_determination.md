# Governance in View of People's Rights and Territorial Rights

> Countries have rights and obligations specified in the UN Charter (e.g. Territorial Rights).
> A people have rights specified in the domestic constitutions and rights defined in various covenants such as the covenants on Civil and Political rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. // Here, as a People are considered governable communities from the size of villages to countries.
> Individual have rights granted by covenants and the Declaration of Human rights (most parts of which are considered customary international law).


> Questions [to be] considered are: Who's Land is It, who governs it (to which extent and which aspects) and who can benefit (from resources, from accumulated wealth, ...) - whereby possible options for who are private persons, private companies, communities, countries, people of the world, intelligent beings ... ?

## Introduction
Whether and if yes under which circumstances a people have the right to secede from a parent country and against the will of the latter is a controversial topic in international law. [*The Normative Status of Self-Determination in International Law: A Formula for Uncertainty in the Scope and Content of the Right?*](#saul-2011) considers different viewpoints by states and scholars.

> The opinion advocated here:
> * autonomy including self determined government.
> * keeping local people out of geopolitics.
> * no forceful measures
> 
> -> [Advocated Path for Self Determination](#advocated-path-for-self-determination).
>
> * clearer specification of self determination in international law. -> [Self Determination in International Law](#self-determination-in-international-law)




## Self Determination in International Law
[in work]
Both the UN charter and the covenants on Civil & Political Rights and on Economic and Cultural state a people have the right for self determination. A people is not specified however. 

> Self-determination including [regional] autonomy and the right for secession is ideally [clearer] specified. Then autonomy questions for regions all across the world can be handled according to specified principles. How the UK allows Scotland to decide itself is considered exemplary, however it is acknowledged that the situation is more complex in other settings when a more central/connecting part wants to secede (for example in Switzerland in 1848, some of the central Cantons wanted to form a 'Sonderbund', which was then prevented by the other cantons.

> Interesting article. Here sometimes a different focus is taken, for example: 
> * When formulating laws for secession one needs to be careful not to discourage regional self governing and [granting] autonomy. 
> * To determine the right of secession, instead of a backward looking approach (i.e. was the right for self determination violated and were there human right violations?), here a forward looking approach is preferred: How a peaceful and feasible future (for which events in the past may have to be taken into account) in agreement with human rights and self determination is achieved ([Preferred Path for Self Determination](#advocated-path-for-self-determination)).

### Languages in Switzerland
In Switzerland there are three main languages, namely Italian (native speakers about 10%), French (native about 20%) and German (about 60%, though learned first and spoken is mainly a local alemannic dialect, collectively referred as Swiss German). Additionally Romansh is an official language and spoken by about 0.5%.

> ## Thoughts on Migration
> *23.9.23: unfinished and in work. possibly to be moved to a separate page, possibly to be commented out as it is currently not a primary focus of this page. Currently online as [considered] an improvement to a prior version.*
>
> Both humanitarian and voluntary migration are advocated in a reasonable and ordered way.
>


> The approach here (in general and for migration) is forward looking. In this sense it is opted for 
> * All people who lived for several years in a region should be allowed to stay and integrated into the country and its legal and social [support] frameworks - 'amnesty' like residence permits could be an option, possibly in exchange with somewhat increased taxes/reduced social support and/or mandatory language courses and/or some time civil service. // Especially as in many regions including Europe stays without 'official' permit have been 'customary law'/accepted for long. 
> * People shouldn't have to take dangerous and/or expensive journeys to find refuge/migrate. 
>   * *Refuge places with human rights guaranteed should be available for everybody anytime.* A possibility are UN governed centers spread across the world.
>   * To migrate locally handed permits/visas for work/asylum/study are advocated.
> 
> Forced or pushed migration (including deportations) are opposed. Regarding deportations as rare exceptions are considered when convicted for serious crimes and a change of country increases or at least not decreases security. Also, a repatriation timely after arrival when there is no legal basis to stay is considered different from a deportation of someone who stayed for several years.
> 
>
#### Humanitarian Migration
Ideally everyone has safe, legal and affordable pathways to secure and adequate places. If needed handing out visas and travel tickets at embassies in the country itself or neighboring countries/refuge camps.
>
<!--
> >In the last decades regional humanitarian migration often worked within Europe. For example most Ukrainian women and children fortunately have safe passage to and legal stay in many European countries. // Men while eligible for asylum, have no safe passage as they are not allowed to leave Ukraine as the government wants them to be available for conscription [the topic is considered worth a discussion]. 
>> * If the war in Ukraine escalates not all in countries, both west and east of Ukraine, safety is guaranteed, thus in this case it is understandable and not unreasonable if people go further for safety reasons. 
-->
> For migration to places fare away such as cross continent migration often humanitarian and voluntary (often economic reasons) migration are mixed, for this cases the rules were not primarily designed and often not work as intended.
>> Law and lawful behavior is advocated here. When circumventing law is widespread, law can and should be adapted: Law, especially humanitarian law, should be designed to protect those who need it most, be reasonable and encourage 'wanted' behavior. 
<!--
* When some earning a lot of money from 'humanitarian' migration (for example smugglers and money lenders who finance smugglers fees) then there is a risk of prolonging or even encouraging human right abuses, conflicts and wars.
-->
>


#### Voluntary Migration
> Legal pathways, especially regional, for migration and work, training & education exchanges are considered beneficial. 
>> Within the European Union and associated countries, voluntary migration is frequent and embedded in a legal framework with free movement agreements - generally it seems to work well though some downsides are observed such as emigration including brain-drain from countries with less competitive salaries whereas countries with high salaries and low taxes have a high inflow migration (especially if there is a low language-barrier as it was the case for UK). 
>
> For example, between Europe and Africa both continents could benefit especially in science, craftsmanship and culture. Between EU/EFTA countries and CIS countries increased interactions of people (and not just interactions at the establishment level or a mere transfer of goods such as gas, oil and cars as it has been done) could help to understand each other other and thereby help to prevent future conflicts.

## Advocated Path for Self Determination

#### No Force
Forcible methods of any kind against [the will of] the local population by *any* party are not considered adequate. Only peaceful forms of protest [if self determination is not granted]. Especially no force before a clear perspective in

<!--[add: not to used force is mostly customary international law, few exceptions]-->

#### Local Self Determination
Here to achieve self-determination and living in a setting which takes local peculiarities into account, a federalist government structure is advocated: Local autonomy including a local government determined by the local people, fair participation in the senior state and respect for the local culture and language. Possibly independent 'regional' sport teams e.g. for football if wished, it works in the UK.

Reasons for autonomy based paths: 
* The world moves closer together:
  * Driven by improvements in communication and transportation, the cooperation and in between states increases. In support borders are becoming less strict. 
  * Technologies are more and more so powerful that many behaviors and actions induce continental or even world-wide effects and risks - to tackle such effects and risks often international cooperations and agreements are helpful or required.
  * Technologies benefit from both local and global cooperation.
* Different cultures in a country have benefits; for example different cultures complement each other by combining different aptitudes. Furthermore, cultural spaces across countries increase interstate interactions and can help understanding & interstate friendships which is good for economics including trade and importantly for peace.
  > * Respect for each other and common base values such as human rights are considered important. It possibly helps to enable and encourage regional and interregional interactions and participation (for example free language courses, though no pressure or grading or participation options starting with regional policy)
  > <!-- notes below are commented out as not fitting here. Additionally content/formulations are unclear and overall just not good. currently biased due to reoccurring personal experiences which do not generalize. it was stupid to write this here with a wrong timing. Sorry. Possibly sometimes a corrected/rewritten version will be published on the people interactions site, where group interactions are considered.
    >> * This only works, when there is respect [for one another]. // When [part of] subgroups (whether small or large) put group membership above respect, society or even human rights and team up to against non-group members, society may break [into pieces]. Additionally significant parts of subgroups using group membership against others may damage the reputation of the entire subgroup. Just no teaming up *against* others - keeping up cultures, customs and friendships is considered positive.-->
  >
  > * Highlighting benefits of multicultural countries, is an argument *not* to consider a uniform society as wish-worthy to achieve or to trying to preserve when history flows different - however it does not mean a uniform society is considered bad when it is like this - cultures tend to spread anyways due to people interactions; which are advocated here and driven by advances in transportation and communication. 
  // What is uniform, is relative and depends on the features considered: For example Kenya diverse in languages ([Languages in Kenya](#refs-languages-in-kenya)) and the North America is diverse in the origin of the last generations of ancestors which are from most parts of the world. // The last generations is emphasized, as when going back fare enough everybody likely has ancestors who once migrated from the lands of todays Kenya (wikipedia on migrations in prehistoric times: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_human_migrations>, genetic evidence for example in LÃ³pez, S. et al. (2016). Human Dispersal Out of Africa: A Lasting Debate. <https://doi.org/10.4137/EBO.S33489> and archeological findings are e.g. described in <https://humanorigins.si.edu/research/east-african-research-projects/olorgesailie-kenya>). -->

  > * In Europe, Switzerland managed to stay out of both world wars. Likely shared cultural space with all neighbors, namely France, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Italy helped to stay neutral and helped not to be drawn into.
