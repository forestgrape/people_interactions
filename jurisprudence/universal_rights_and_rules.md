### Terminology
* A state: a country
* Covenant: a formal agreement
* Treaty: an agreement between states. Some treaties require signature and/or ratification to comes into force. 
Convention: 
  * a behavior pattern which is usually expected to be followed.
  * an agreement between states, less formal than a treaty
* Rule: a specified behavior pattern which is expected to be followed.
* Law: A collection/system of rules formally agreed to be valid within a country or between countries. A rule which is specified in the law is called legally binding.
* International Law: Law valid for several countries. (International: involving several countries.)
* Jus cogens = Peremptory norms: a subset of rules that are strongly expected to be follow. There is an informal consensus that examples are the prohibitions of genocide, torture, piracy, and slavery. Article 53 of the [Vienna Convention on the law of treaties](#vienna-convention-on-the-law-of-treaties) declares treaties violating peremptory norms as void, however the convention does not specify such peremptory norms.
* Erga omnes (latin: towards all) rules are rules which are owned towards all states. A practical implications is, that any state has the right to complain on a breach in an erga omnes rule even if the state complaining is not affected itself. In the [case Gambia vs Myanmar on a possible genocide by Myanmar](#gambia-v-myanmar-on-genocide) the ICJ argues in point 41. """... The Court held that these provisions generated “obligations [which] may be defined as ‘obligations erga omnes partes’ in the sense that each State party has an interest in compliance with them in any given case” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 449, para. 68). It follows that any State party to the Genocide Convention, and not only a specially affected State, may invoke the responsibility of another State party with a view to ascertaining the alleged failure to comply with its obligations erga omnes partes, and to bring that failure to an end."""




### Who designs and judges Universal Rules

#### International Law Commission (ILC)
* "The International Law Commission (ILC) is a body of experts responsible for helping develop and codify international law.[1][2] It is composed of 34 individuals recognized for their expertise and qualifications in international law, who are elected by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) every five years."

  The Court’s role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies.

  The Court is composed of 15 judges, who are elected for terms of office of nine years by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. It is assisted by a Registry, its administrative organ. Its official languages are English and French.""" (<https://www.icj-cij.org/en/court>, 7.12.22)

## Territorial Rights

### Trade in Territory

> Unfinished and in consideration/work.

> Trading territory is not considered ideal here, but better than an unilateral decisions (including unilateral referenda) and much better than military force.

Until the 19th century, land changing ownership by deals between countries or regions/cities buying themselves out from larger empires was practiced and accepted.

In todays world, that a region wants to secede but not both sides agree is a common challenge. 

> Territorial changes by unilateral referenda or by internal or external military force often causes instability and yielded many wars throughout history. Accepting unilateral territorial changes could set a 2022 precedent causing (increased) instability in the world.

The possibility of buying out at a 'fair' price could be an option when all parties agree - the involved countries and the local population (possibly with 60% or even a 2/3 majority). Buying/selling land may cause instability too, that's to consider. However if the prices are fair, stability is possibly retained. Between countries a territory exchange is another option (when the local populations agree).

> When private person can own, buy and sell land [more than needed for self-usage], why not countries or communities? 




## Considerations on Self Determination
[*The Normative Status of Self-Determination in International Law: A Formula for Uncertainty in the Scope and Content of the Right?*](#saul-2011) by Matthew Saul considers the different viewpoints by states and scholars.


> Opinion advocated here, is to establish autonomy: [Advocated Path for Self Determination](#paths-for-self-determination).

> Some interesting points though not all consideration are agreed here. 
> One is when formulating laws for secession, it can prevent or endanger a path of [granting] autonomy. Another is to determine the right of secession, instead of a backward looking approach (i.e. was the right for self determination violated and were there human right violations?), here a forward looking approach is preferred: How a peaceful and feasible future (for which events in the past may have to be taken into account) in agreement with human rights and self determination is achieved ([Preferred Path for Self Determination](#advocated-path-for-self-determination)).

### Advocated Path for Self Determination
Here to achieve self-determination and living in a setting taking into account local peculiarities, a federalist government structure with local autonomy, fair and proportional participation in the senior state and respect for the local culture and language is favored over border changes/secession. 
Reasons are: 
* The world moves closer together:
  * Driven by improvements in communication and transportation, the cooperation between states increases. In support borders are becoming less strict. 
  * Technologies are more and more so powerful, world-wide effects are possible - solutions of such challenges and risks often benefit from a world-wide cooperations and agreements.
* Multicultural countries have many benefits:
 * More efficient as the strengths of different cultures can be combined. 
 * Cultural spaces across countries increase interstate interactions and can help understanding & interstate friendships.
    > In Europe, Switzerland managed to stay out of both world wars. While neutrality was a factor, likely the shared cultural space with all neighbors, namely France, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Italy helped.
* *Peace.*
