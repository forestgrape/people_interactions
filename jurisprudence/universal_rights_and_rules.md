## Introduction
[in work]

International law is about rules which are considered globally valid. Here universal rules is chosen as title since: International law, is not a well structured and codified legal systems as those within states.  International law can be viewed as an evolving set of rules which are excepted to be followed by all concerning actors around the world.

### Comparison to Inner-state Legal Systems
[in work]


### Terminology
##### Def State
State and country are used synonymously. Historically, sometimes the term 'Nation' is/has been used to denote a country. The term international law derives from this.

##### Def Rule
A specified behavior pattern which is expected to be followed.

##### Def Law
A collection/system of rules formally agreed to be valid within a country or between countries. A rule which is specified in the law is called legally binding.

##### Def International Law
Used to denote rules considered as globally valid both for states and people.

> Originally international law mainly concerned inter-state relations (especially 'regulating' wars in Europe) such as the Hague conventions. // at a time when the nation state concept was en vogue and thus inter-*national*.

##### Def Customary International Law
Customary international law is when a certain behavior pattern or declaration has become a widespread accepted and is expected to be followed.

##### Def Treaty Like
Treaty, convention, covenant or declaration all commonly used to denote agreements between states, though not always equivalently.

> Usually treaty conventions and covenants imply obligations where as a declaration is rather an intent (though a declaration can become [customary law](#def-customary-international-law).

Below the terms Treaty, Covenant and Convention are defined for the usage here.

###### Def Treaty
An agreement between states. Some treaties require signature and/or ratification to comes into force.

###### Def Covenant
An agreement which usually is fundamental in essence. Examples are the Covenants of 

###### Def Convention
In international law, a convention is used to denote an agreement between multiple states (often concluded at a large meeting of states). 
> Examples are the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions ([ABC of International Law](#swiss-government)).

> The word conventions has also the meanings:
> 1. A behavior pattern which is common or even expected to be followed.
>       > In international law, compulsory  behavior patterns are known as [customary law](#def-customary-international-law).
> 2. Large meetings themselves are also called conventions.
> 
>> Convention and Covenant both come from latin convenire which means come together (both  to assemble or to agree, to confirm). 

##### Def Jus Cogens
##### Def Peremptory Norms
Jus Cogens also known as Peremptory norms: A subset of rules that are strongly expected to be follow. Article 53 of the [Vienna Convention on the law of treaties](#vienna-convention-on-the-law-of-treaties) declares treaties violating peremptory norms as void. However, the convention does not specify such peremptory norms.
There is an informal consensus that the prohibitions of genocide, torture, piracy, and slavery are jus cogens.

##### Def Erga Omnes
Erga omnes (latin: towards all) rules are owned towards all states. A practical implications is, that any state has the right to complain on a breach of an erga omnes rule, even if the state complaining is not affected itself. In the [case Gambia vs Myanmar on a possible genocide by Myanmar](#gambia-v-myanmar-on-genocide) the ICJ states in 41. """... The Court held that these provisions generated “obligations [which] may be defined as ‘obligations erga omnes partes’ in the sense that each State party has an interest in compliance with them in any given case” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 449, para. 68). It follows that any State party to the Genocide Convention, and not only a specially affected State, may invoke the responsibility of another State party with a view to ascertaining the alleged failure to comply with its obligations erga omnes partes, and to bring that failure to an end."""
