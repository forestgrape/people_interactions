## Summary
*Terminology, legal specifications and practice:* Sanctions are used to denote restrictions taken by a state or a group of state on another state. <!--In international law, sanctions are not well specified. to confirm--> Sanctions are often decided ad hoc by the executive.
*Motivations/Goals:* Sanctions are motivated by different goals such as justice-system-like (e.g. break of international law), capability control (e.g. prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons) or political (e.g. restrict an unfriendly government). *Implementations:* Depending on the goal of a sanction, different implementations are possible such as economic, technological or travel restrictions.

> A more formalized and specified international justice system with predefined sanctions could increase predictability and so preventive effects play more and sanctions are less [perceived as] unfair.


## Notes
> The notes below list goals and methods of sanctions. Mostly it is **a list without judgement and not all items are supported here** (a personal viewpoint in [Opinion on Sanctions](#opinion-on-sanctions).

> This page is *general and not specifically* about the invasion of Russia into the Ukraine which is part of a complex conflict between Russia, the EU, the NATO and different fractions within the Ukraine - although this conflict[s] motivates the current publishing. Accordingly some statements do apply and some do not apply. Considerations on sanctions for that special situation are not yet published (considerations will soon be published in the context of the [conflict](../conflicts/ru_ukr_conflict.md)).

### Opinion on Sanctions
> * As in most justice systems, here a causal and direct connection is considered as necessary to sanction an entity. 
> * Sanctioning entities with the goal they pressurize others is not supported here.
> * Openness of diplomatic is considered crucial i.e. sanctions hindering the diplomatic channels are not supported here.
> * The effect of sanctions on 3rd parties is ideally minimized unless consulted first (usually only possibly in the state imposing sanctions).
> * Reversibility i.e. not lasting effects once the sanctions are lifted, at least for sanctions taken ad hoc for coercion/motivation. // Sanctions targeting complex supply or support chains can be hard to reverse. For sanctions targeting (military) capabilities, this is possibly hard to avoid or is even a purpose.
> * *Some(times) sanctions can violate human rights - the opinion here is, that in such situations alternatives should be searched/considered.*




## International Jurisprudence
International jurisprudence is still not very formalized/specified and the concept of sanctions varies depending on the situations and the agents taken sanctions. Often sanctions are taken by governments after actions they do not approve e.g. (perceived) violation of security interests or for actions (presumably) violating international laws or disapproved for other reasons.


> Here it is opted for a better basis and regulation of sanctions in international law - especially for sanction related to the international justice systems - so that they indeed work like a justice system i.e. predictable but not arbitrary penalties => preventive effects and more accepted as fair.

> Here mainly sanctioning of countries is considered and not of (Juridical) persons. The latter is *not* supported here in general: Can having a certain nationality or being friend with somebody, be a reason to be sanctioned? In most legal systems, the formers are not reasons e.g. when a company does wrong it's employees are usually not punished unless they did wrong, similar for friends or relatives of 'wrong-doers' unless they did wrong themselves there is no punishment.




## Goals of Sanctions

Sanctions are grouped here into the purposes/goals/motivations:
* justice-system-like i.e. follow the international laws/principles
* capability control
* political


### Justice System Like Goals
Discourage unwanted behavior e.g. the usage of banned weapons.
* Similar to laws within a country which motivate legal behavior through restrictions/punishment otherwise.
* *Role of Sanctions:*  
  * make the estimated 'return value' of unwanted behaviors negative i.e. the average sentence is [much] higher than the average gain.
  * to prevent injustice i.e. sentence a crime such that not only the victim
* For effectiveness, predictability and acceptance, these sanctions usually have to be predefined.


### Educative Like Goals
Encourage a wanted certain behavior e.g. promote [economic] freedom. 

> Usually 'implemented' not as sanctions but as a reward based approach. However in some situations - e.g. when the rewards are near universal and bound to a single topic - the concepts are not clearly separable i.e. when everybody gets a reward except those failing on a single topic, sanctioning on the specific topic has the same effect.


### Capability Control Goals
* *Reduction of Military Capabilities:* Prevention to acquire certain capabilities. Prevention can target single goods or entire industries. E.g. export restrictions on technologies to produce nuclear weapons or long-range rockets. // may target many other industries

* *Reduction of the Capabilities to do War:* Sanctioning a state to reduce its ability to do war.
   > Usually also includes the reduction of military capabilities. 

### Political Goals
* *Staying Neutral:* As staying neutral means supporting neither side in a conflict, in some asymmetric conflicts economic restrictions on invaders can be adequate. For example when only one country invades, warfare only takes place in the invaded country, which (usually) shoots its economy - on the other hand the economy of the invader continues running, thus continuing trade can mean supporting the invader.

* *Politically motivated Restrictions:* E.g. sanctioning a country with an unfriendly government.




## Methods and Targets of Sanctions
Depending on the goals the targets and methods differ.

> Depending on the methods, there is the risk to (overly) restrict not involved 3rd persons e.g. civilians not having to do anything and limited options to oppose a wrong doing by a government - even in a democracy options can be limited and/or late. There are good reasons to avoid to overly restricting 3rd persons: 1) For humanity reasons - especially crucial when the motivation for sanctions are humanity like reasons, and  2) to prevent 'generating'/being [perceived as] a common extern enemy.

Sanctions can be implemented as:

> the list below is without judgement and not all points are supported here

* Economic restrictions targeting:
  * the entire economy
  * certain economic branches
  * individuals
  * the state income
* Property/Financial restrictions.
* Travel restrictions.
* International Collaboration and Organizations e.g. restrict access to sport or to science meetings




## Appendix
### Justice System
**in work**

A framework specifying/defining actions and a predefined or at least predictable set of sentences for unwanted actions to discourage them.

#### Purpose of Sentences 
* Negative Return value: make the [perceived] 'return value' of unwanted behaviors negative i.e. the expected sentence is [much] higher than the expected gain. // excepted in the mathematical sense i.e. a hypothetical average over many cases.
* Justice: Sentence a crime such that what is perceived as just by 'social norms' is achieved. // 1) What is perceived as just by social norms usually implies a negative return value. 2) What is specified in the law/decided by judges can serve as definition of just and with time develop into a 'social norm'. 
* Educational: Educate a convicted not to break laws in the future.

#### Relevance of Sentences
[in work/consideration]
In national laws:
Justice is a major goal of civil law.
Negative return values and an educational process are key in criminal law. In criminal law a main goal is to prevent criminal actions at minimal costs for society.
