## Tweet Summary
This page contains thoughts/considerations interact and team up to groups. Then we interact as individuals and as part of groups. Countries are viewed as groups and settings for peaceful interactions are searched.



## Summary 
*A group* is used to denote a specific subset of a population of people. *Teams* are defined as groups with a common goal. *Organizations* are defined as organized teams. There are different forms of organizations. For most organizations the decision process is hierarchical.

Interactions between the different agents (individuals, groups, teams, organizations) are considered with the goal to identify settings which enable friendly interactions.
It is suggested, that friendly interactions are promoted, when 
* many members are included in the decision process
* membership is open
* there are many voluntary interactions
  > Voluntary interactions are assumed in the following and not especially written for a better reading flow. Non voluntary are explicitly stated as such.
* the teams are connected


When viewing countries as organizations, the above reads: With many interactions and fluent borders the chance for friendly relations is higher. 
* With many people being involved in the decision process, the chance for friendly interactions is higher. As with many people it is more likely some are friends or have common friends with the other site.
* When forming unions of countries, organizations with open membership and fluent borders are best at ensuring peace.
  > The United Nations is an open organization and in agreement it has a good track record at providing peace.

* Inside countries when the society is 'fair' and fluent (not fractioned into different classes), there is few space for class struggles.
  > Revolutions happened mainly in situations where a segregated and a small class controlled most of the wealth.
* Between countries, when there are lots of interactions especially at the 'decision making'/leadership level, the chances for friendship is higher and thus the chances for tensions, hostile actions and especially war are lower.

  > Borders between states seem to some extent necessary to enable a local/own governance & responsibility and solidary societies (in view of the current inequalities and taxation schemes). // Though the system should be such that every region/society/country has a fair chance to develop as it wants.


  > When the decision makers are friends, hostile actions are rare. => Meetings of parliament/assembly members are considered helpful. Parliaments member often are in office for quite long and additionally they are many members, so a parliament can have friend around the world and especially with all neighboring countries. To have friendships between leadership groups is higher when the groups are larger.




## Relevance
International Relations: How to design and promote. Whether or not to cut ties in conflicts.




> ## Opinion on Interactions
> *Opinion on Pairwise Interactions*
> * Interactions are advocated, as they form the basis of friendship building and the more interactions there are, the more likely any two people in the world have common friends.
> * Here the opinion is, to keep open communication channels even/especially in conflicts.
>
> *Opinion on Teams*
> Ideally we act as ONE team or as teams cooperating friendly or at least as teams competing fair & peacefully - with the goal to tackle together the many challenges we face to improve the life of every-body step by step while keeping the world in a good state.

>> As an important task is considered getting AI (Artificial Intelligence) and AL (Artificial Life) right and especially not wrong. 
>> Life here, denotes a thing with environment interactions which is able to produce rough copies of itself. 
>> [Before] we know we [may] turn out to be life creators: 
>> * An instance of an Artificial Intelligence in the Internet is possibly able to transform to AIL (Artificial Intelligent Life) if it is capable enough and has survival instincts.
>> * With synthetically assembling RNA/DNA sequences, life forms which are not possible (or at least very unlikely) to arise naturally can be created. Such life forms are considered artificial life here. Just modifying single nucleotides or rearranging/combining existing life forms is considered here as at the border between artificial life and modified natural life, as such life forms can arise naturally.  <!--// Self amplifying RNAs (RNA which encodes proteins to replicate itself) could possibly give rise to such life forms if they infect immortal cell lines. // While containing synthetic RNAs the Covid vaccines from Moderna and Biontech are *not* self amplifying i.e. these RNA do not encode proteins to replicate themselves.-->





## Groups, Teams and Organizations

> ###### Groups
> Groups are used here to denote fixed subsets from a certain collection of people having some common interest.

> ###### Teams
> Teams are defined as people working together towards a common goal.

> ###### Organizations
> Organizations are organized teams.

* *Relations between Groups, Teams and Organizations:* According to the definitions used here: 
  * teams are groups
  * organizations are teams

* *Decision Making:* Organizations are often structured hierarchically and the decision making follows often also a this pattern. The hierarchy can be fixed or changing. In teams which are not organized the decision making is individual.




## Individual and Team Interactions
Interactions can be viewed differently. Here only the following aspects of interactions are considered:
* An individual can act towards another individual [friendly, neutral or unfriendly](#friendliness-of-interactions)
* Two or more individuals can team up and form a team.

> ###### Friendliness of Interactions
> The actions are defined by: Friendly actions are appreciated by the 'receiver', neutral are indifferent and unfriendly actions are not appreciated.



### Relations and Interactions between Groups

##### Membership Relations Considered
* How groups/teams/organizations related each other namely whether there are many members [connecting](#membership-connection) them.
* How fluent the membership borders namely whether there are several degrees of membership and what are the conditions on becoming member

> Membership intersections && connections are especially important at the decision level i.e. when the leaders of team A and team B are well connoted, a friendly relationship is more likely. 

> ##### Membership Connection
> A group G *connects* the members of team A to team B if G contains members of team A and team B.

Example of a Membership Connection:
Usually persons are member of exactly one country => countries have usually distinct members. If an organization Org (e.g. WWF, FIFA, ISS or commercial such as Nestle/CocaCola/Gazprom/Renault) operates in both countries, the members of country A and of country B are members of Org and thus Org connects country A and country B.



#### Group Memberships and Interactions
##### Interactions Considered
Teams can compete or cooperate in various ways or have no connection. Here considered are: 
* The 'friendliness' of interactions: friendly, neutral or hostile interactions.
* The frequency of interactions



#### The Interplay between Membership Relations and Interactions
* Teams with intersections (members belonging to both teams), mostly have friendly or at least neutral interactions and nearly never hostile interactions. One reason is that usually unfriendly interactions are stopped and friendly interactions increased.
* If team A and team B have many connections (), the chance for hostile actions is quite low.





## Examples

### Ancient Times
* Prehistorical Times
  In prehistorical times, people groups lived in tribes. For tribes one is/was usually member of only one tribe.

* Early Medieval Age
  Feudal Systems: The nobility governs land provided by the monarch and in turn pays tribute and provides military services. The majority of people lived as peasants with few rights and limited ownership. Slavery(-like) living settings were common in many regions.

<!--late middle ages: todo quite a lot of actors such as the clerics, the nobility, guilds, independent farmers -->

=> In ancient times, the people were often only part of only one team holding power namely the feudal lord and the ruling monarch. Violent conflicts were frequent at those times, though often limited in scale.

### Modern World
In modern times one is usually part of different teams/organizations which hold power and property: The country of living, company(ies) associated (work, ownership), social organizations and religion.

#### Countries
The population living in a certain area belongs to a country. The decision structure in countries is usually highly organized and hierarchically. In democracies the top members are determined by elections. In direct democracies the decision process itself is also subject to votes. Countries are often subdivided in administrative districts enabling decentralization. Regarding peace and war, countries are the most important organizational unit since the military command is usually per country. 
> Often the larger the population part that takes part in a country's decision process, the less likely the country will start a war. At the start of a war, a broad support in the population is/was rare. [todo statistics]

Many countries have a single leader, often with large power. Being perfect, every day, for years is nearly impossibly i.e. even if brilliant mistakes usually happen, especially in unforeseen situations.

> Having multiple persons deciding, likely makes the decision process more stable and less influenced by situation specific moods (we all are humans). Additionally when having a group of leaders, different talents and experiences can improve the decision process: For example the wit of young to mid age, experience and broad consideration with age. <!--// with age the number of neuronal connections increase. The speed is faster at young age. to cite -->

Examples with broad decision processes:
* When parliaments/assemblies are involved, especially in decisions with legislative character.
* Some countries have the executive decision power  shared across several people (e.g. the Swiss government consists of 7 members, called Bundesrat, in countries with Politburos, the Politburos take important decisions [to check decision making and the specific power in the different countries]). 
  

#### Companies
> in work

The structure in companies is usually hierarchically as follows: A board of directors is elected by the owners=shareholders. The board takes strategic decisions and elects a chairman which has mainly executive functions and implement the strategy. 
> The employees only in very rare cases have any rights to be part in the decision making.

#### Social Organizations
Social organizations: E.g. sport clubs, political parties, scouts.

#### Religions
Religions are highly divers reaching from explanations of schools of life to concrete laws and how to behave to various forms of ideologies.
