## New Content and Updates


24.9.: The plebiscites can be a chance when held & interpreted fairly and the results are handled in agreement with international law. // how they are carried out, specifically whether fair and free, is not judged here.

When the question is whether people want closer ties to Russia:
* In territories occupied since February only a NO is meaningful: 
  * Voting Result YES: As many people who oppose Russia likely left and thus they can't participate and additionally people possibly don't dare to vote 'NO' - especially not when armed personal is present at the voting. => A YES is possibly due to people being afraid or away.
  * Voting Result NO: If people vote NO to closer ties with Russia, this is a clear message to the Russian soldiers to leave the region in question.
* In the regions termed by the local administrations as ‘People’s Republics’ of Donetsk (DNR) and Luhansk (LNR) the vote is neither likely to be representative but possibly wrong in both directions: While many people may have fled or feel pressured to vote yes, many strong supporters may be fighting and unable to vote. A YES in these regions thus is somewhat more meaningful.
  > In case of a YES, to both respect international law and the people's opinion (and the right for self determination) a possible solution could to keep DNR and LNR as autonomous regions of the Ukraine but to enable the people close interactions with Russia (for example a custom union with Russia and free movement of people with Russia). In this case for the people of DNR and LNR would be part of the Ukraine and in most practical aspects also of Russia.


> *The above notes may read as complete nonsense without any connection to reality.* Well possibly that's true. One reason they are written nevertheless is, plebiscites are not per se unlawful even when there are territorial disputes. When everybody would be committed to peace and the right for self determination of the people from the Donbas, meaningful plebiscites could not be ruled out.

> Plebiscites are always welcome here as long as they are free and handled lawfully. 



> ### Gorbachev on War
> "... When I became General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, I traveled to towns and villages across the country to meet people, to introduce myself and to talk. And there was one thing everyone talked about. They said to me: 'Mikhail Sergeyevich, whatever problems we may have, whatever food shortages, don't worry, we'll have enough food. We'll grow it. We'll manage. Just make sure there's no war.' I was stunned. That's how the people were. That's how much they had suffered in the last war. ..." from a [2019 BBC Interview](#gorbachev-bbc-interview-2019), translated by BBC.

## Board

### Human Rights
*We all - everyone - are granted with the same human rights*.



### Innocence of the People of Ukraine
There seems to be a consensus in belief that *the people of Ukraine are innocent*.




### Diplomacy and Compromises
Diplomacy and Compromises from All Parties are likely the best Way out
* 'best' in the sense of - given the current situation - an optimal/least bad outcome considering *all* the people.
* An overall agreed fully just way out is likely very difficult to reach. 'Acceptable' just/unjust is possibly enough for peace, even long-term.




### Keeping Civilians out
Keeping civilians out of warfare is considered a common interest for *all* parties 1) to prevent suffering and losses and 2) in the long run to prevent to divide people and antagonistic thinking. Such effects can last long, especially when the suffering is high. With modern imaging (e.g. satellites/drones) pictures showing or hinting the brutality of war reach the world.

> Paths to escape, to reach a safe and in any way - including ethically - reasonable place are considered important. 




### Truce

A stop of all military actions are important to prevent further escalation and losses and to bolster diplomacy. 

#### Reasons for a Ceasefire
> With the daily tragedies occurring and military analyses and decision required during a war, it can be hard to focus on essential topics such as: 
> * Strengthen global security and make the world more peaceful - stopping military actions is a first step towards peace.
> * Tackling the fundamental question of international law such as under which circumstances a region has the right for which degree of autonomy or even joining another country or alliance if such a right exists. // Here the opinion is that regional autonomy is ideally specified in the UN charter. Then autonomy questions for regions such as Scotland (how the UK allows Scotland to decide itself is considered exemplary.
), Taiwan, Donbas, Kosovo, Basque County, regions where natives live in the US, Canada, Australia and so on can be handled according to specified principles (the situations for named regions differ hugely, so possibly a set of principles is needed). In some cases a possible solution could be the right for a self determined local government with certain economic freedoms and possibly independent 'regional' sport teams e.g. for football (if wished, the UK shows it works. Though the gain of local identification (and the chance to play) seems to come at some cost in competitiveness.

> Negotiations, a true ceasefire and true and overall accepted peace, can get more difficult with further escalation. 

>> Here the focus is on [searching paths to] peace and *not* on military topics. <!-- tactical/military discussions are challenging anyways to keep neutrality (unless [considered] useful for both)-->


#### Ceasefire Implementation Option
> The opinion here is to obtain a ceasefire with few conditions: for both sides to agree the conditions likely need to be such that no side gets significant (tactical) advantages/disadvantages (this can involve freeze of the current situation such as a position freezes and stopping of non combat actions such as building up defenses or even material and troupe mobilization and/or movements outside of warfare areas). An accepted peace agreement - for which fairness, justice and overall acceptance is considered important - then can be found through negotiations.





### Considerations on military, diplomatic, economical and scientific Perspectives
After several months of war, further warfare may not improve negotiation positions of either site but cause unnecessary brutality and losses - including to civilians for example when trying to conquer foreign cities and be associated to dangers of escalation.

From a military perspective, the Ukrainian defenders seem able to reconquer some territory. One reason is that in recently occupied territory the Russian defenses are not (yet) strong and the support from the local population is low, not there or adverse. However, how much actual territorial regains improve their negotiation position is unclear since both sides likely are aware of this capability and other points such as lessening of current and prevention of further sanctions, the overall security framework and restoration of relations with Ukraine and others (such as the US and European countries) are likely more important for Russia than territory.
Broad Russian advances are less likely since the Ukrainian defenses are strong: fortified positions, the light modern weapons are very well suited to defend these fortified positions - and the Ukrainian soldiers are able to use them efficiently, which is not at all a matter of course: skill, courage, tactical cleverness and organization are necessary - and they fight for and in their homeland which is a huge boost.

> Bloody battles can be spared for computer/console titles.

From prosperity and development perspective a stop of war seems crucial for both Ukraine and for Russia: if the war escalates or continues much longer an increased and possibly permanent (people tend to settle with time) exodus of skilled workers respectively of the young generation is a risk - with possibly impeding their scientific and economic capabilities (and thereby also the military capabilities) for a long time - though when people tend to come back (i.e. such that there is no large population/brain drain) and keep friendships there are also chances.








## Notes
The focus is on human rights [for individuals], many of which are violated in a war. Thus the page is *pro peace* and *against war*. A goal is to search for practicable [paths to peace](#paths-to-peace). For that reason to judge or point right/wrong doing is not the focus and it is attempted to take a neutral standpoint regarding states (personal viewpoint transparent in the [appendix](#appendix)).

* Global Organizations such as the United Nations, the IAEA, the WHO, Amnesty International and the Red Cross are considered important.

* Information sources are listed in  [resources](#resources). Frequently consulted are The Guardian, MoscowTimes, Tass, KievPost, UKRinform

* It is attempted to write always *factual & respectful & avoiding confrontation*, especially as this writing is public.
     > On the page on coronaviruses, sometimes the writing was heated and confrontational (written when stressed and/or influenced by the heated atmosphere) which was bad mistake and possibly even counterproductive. Sorry.

* Likely/near sure: Mistakes happen here and not all content is up to the task. 

* Feedback is welcome - especially pointing out mistakes and improvement suggestions.










## Paths to Peace

Consideration and searching for possible pathways to lasting peace.

### Security for Ukraine
* General [security considerations for Europe and the world](#security-in-europe-and-the-world) apply also to Ukraine as the largest country entirely within Europe.
* A strong technology and defense industry in Ukraine by international cooperation and support.
* A neutral status for Ukraine combined with (legally binding) security guarantees (the guarantees from the Budapest memorandum have not been enough [clear]). // officially in discussion



### Security for Russia
As Russia is a global power and the largest country of Europe, Asia and the world, the security of Russia is mainly considered in the context of [Security of Europe and the World](#security-in-europe-and-the-world). [in work]




### Security in Europe and the World
* Demilitarized or at least no offensive weapons alongside the borders of countries. // A natural such zone would be Russian-Ukrainian border as for the both countries strengthen their security is key.
* Increasing the Security by Limiting (Offensive) Military:
  * Reducing the number of offensive weapons. 
    > As suitable weapons for offensive actions are usually mobile and/or heavily armored/stealth and/or have a long range such as rockets (including hypersonic rockets), airplanes (especially stealth airplanes and long-range bombers), armored vehicles (including tanks and armored self propelled artillery) and long-range (combat)drones.
  * Limits on exercises: 
    * the number of troupes in exercises.
    * Limit tests and exercises involving offensive weapons.
* Redesign of security architectures and designing/strengthening partnerships/cooperations/trust-building programs (e.g. the United Nations, the OSCE in Europe and [NATO trust building](#nato-trust-building) for example extending partnership for peace like cooperations).




### NATO Trust building
> *in work and unfinished*


The increase the international trust into NATO there are different options ranging from reforms to a re-founding/replacement.

#### NATO Reforms/Reorientation
* Reforms to increase transparency. 
* Clearer (more purpose and actions defining) statutes and possibly a focus more on defense. <!-- possibly only weapon exports to country which adhere certain principles of humanity for example no death sentence, an overall fair legal system, local self determination for example by elections -->
* Open interstate cooperations to manage the challenges we face - the NATO expertise is broad
* A focus on tasks such as crisis management and state-independent threats such as terrorism ([NATO counter Terrorism](#nato-counter-terrorism-reference-curriculum)).

##### Refs NATO Reforms
NATO Watch: <https://natowatch.org/about>


#### NATO Rename/Refound/Replacement
A re-founding by a new, a fusion with/into an existing (e.g. OSCE) organization or already a renaming would emphasize reforms/reorientation and get rid of cold war associations. In that sense it is to acknowledge that the Cold War ended peacefully - as Havel put it: 
“It is a question of prestige. This is the reason why I talked about the new European security system without mentioning NATO. Because, if it grew out of NATO, it would have to be named something else, if only because of the element of prestige. ... But if NATO can transform itself – perhaps in conjunction with the Helsinki process – it would look like a peaceful process of change, not defeat.” from Document 12-2 in [Savranskaya and Blaton](#savranskaya-and-blanton-2017).


#### NATO Tasks and Background
The NATO, once was founded to contain the expansionist Soviet Union ruled under the horribly brutal [Stalinism](#thoughts-on-aspects-of-stalinism) (NATO: Founding treaty <https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67656.htm?>), developed into the most powerful military alliance on earth ever. The NATO frames (and today sees?) itself as a defensive alliance protecting democratic principles and human rights. Other states, including Russia, perceive the NATO differently.


> ##### Thoughts on Aspects of Stalinism
> Stalinism seems to have relied much to much on brutality and 'forced alliances', so the local willingness to cooperate was often missing and the system turned out to be not sustainable. It can even be doubted that the Warsaw Pact would have passed a serious stress test, especially after the crackdowns of protests in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Adverse feelings from the brutality of Stalinism such as deportations and ignorance of human rights seem to have been handed down the generations and last till today.



> ##### NATO in the Yugoslavian Wars
> In early 90's is was not [officially] clear respectively stated what's the purpose of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and even if there still was any. NATO officials sometimes stated a more a political and less military organization. 
> 
> During the Yugoslavian Wars the NATO then was first ever involved as military party. The war was brutal including crimes such as ethnic cleansing from multiple parties. Postwar, the NATO and the EU incorporated the North-Western republics Slovenia and Croatia which happen to be the wealthiest and also happen to be mainly Roman Catholic. While the NATO framed itself as NACHO (North AdriatiC Human-rights Organization) and what the 'Western' media illuminated through the fog of war was accordingly (respectively the intelligence services released to the media). For others, the NATO possibly fought a proxy war and so the NATO possibly stood for something like Nationalistic Augmenting Threat Organization.
> > Looking from the outside and backwards it is hard to judge what really happened - who did what with which goals at which point in time. One approach is focussing on the pre and post situation which avoids having to analyze foggy warfare, doing this - lets say - it seems possibly that the NATO was *not* 'squeaky clean'.
> 
> Though the situation was complex and accordingly decision making. The region of former Yugoslavia had/has a complex history as most states have. There were Nationalistic and/or separatist tendencies throughout the existence of the Yugoslavian state. Moreover in the 90's, previously granted minority rights and autonomy were (discussed to be) cut down.
> * Possibly increased/ensured autonomy could have avoided a war, possibly with help of the UN and clearer specified UN charter regarding autonomy rights.
> * The Open Balkan Project seems a promising path for the future.

FOREWORD

“With guns you can kill terrorists, with education you can kill terrorism.” — Malala Yousafzai, Pakistani activist for female education and Nobel Prize laureate

NATO’s counter-terrorism efforts have been at the forefront of three consecutive NATO Summits, including the
recent 2019 Leaders’ Meeting in London, with the clear political imperative for the Alliance to address a persistent global threat that knows no border, nationality or religion.

NATO’s determination and solidarity in fighting the evolving challenge posed by terrorism has constantly increased since the Alliance invoked its collective defence clause for the first time in response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 on the United States of America.

NATO has gained much experience in countering terrorism from its missions and operations. However, NATO cannot defeat terrorism on its own. Fortunately, we do not stand alone. One of the strengths the Alliance can build on is our engagement with the global network of partner countries and other International Organizations who bring in a wealth of experience and knowledge. Many of these have contributed to the development of this reference curriculum, together with the Partnership for Peace Consortium of Defence Academies and Security Studies Institutes.

Understanding the terrorist threat of today and tomorrow requires not only improved awareness but constant learning and investment in the education of future generations. We sincerely hope that this curriculum will serve the wider counter-terrorism community as an insightful reference document and that it can contribute to national educational processes of both interested Allies and partners, including through NATO’s Defence Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP).

##### NATO - Russia Tensions
There is a strong opposition from Russia to the expansion of NATO to its close neighbors, especially since the mid 90s. Possible reasons for this are: 
* From the Cold War, the NATO itself or at least the name carries [some] ballast: "It is true that ordinary Russians have a fairly negative attitude towards NATO: only a third think that Russia’s membership of the Alliance would be desirable. Yet, at the same time a majority of Russians would be ready to join ‘a military–political alliance together with European countries and the United States’." as stated in [Forsberg 2005](#forsberg-05).
* The NATO actions and interventions in the Yugoslavian Wars were [perceived] aggressive and in violation with international laws (including the UN charter).
* The NATO was/is [perceived] anti Russian, which is official since the Madrid conference 2022 - though it practically always has been at least to some extent e.g. there are constraint for countries to operate NATO and Russian military equipment alongside).







### Fluent European Borders
> in work

Ideally each two neighboring countries have friendly and close interactions. In this sense the borders of country groups become smooth/fluent. Such that when traveling from the British Isles to Türkiye and the Levant, from Scandinavia to the Maghreb or from Portugal to Russia all the borders are smooth.

As the major player and designer in Europe, the European Union has a key role but all European or bordering country groups such as the EAEU, the CIS, the AU and the EFTA, are essential, as are all the countries themselves.

> Possibly the The European Political Community proposed by the President Macron could be a suitable setting to discuss/establish smoother borders. // modelled similar to the [African Union](#african-union) is - possibly also as yet another European state group.

### Governance and Territorial Situations
#### Donbas
Autonomy (of varying degrees). Autonomy was a central part of the Minsk agreements (Minsk 1 and Minsk 2)
  > * currently unclear if the Minsk agreements are still a viable path.
  > * Taking into account the opinion of the people is considered nice, especially considering the events around Euromaidan. 
  > * The impression here is: Ukrainians like to decide themselves. The people from the Donbas like to decide themselves whether, when and how to reintegrate. Close and good relations to Russia are of great importance for them.


#### Kherson oblast *west of Dnieper including the city Kherson*. 
Significance: Full (political, economic and security) control likely crucial for Ukraine, likely even for a ceasefire. Since: 1) Nearly 300'000 people called the city of Kherson their home in 2021 and it is an important economical location for Ukraine.  2) It could be used as a base for attacks on other cities west of the Dnieper (even as this seems to be not acute as of July 2022, for the people in South western Ukraine this is may still have psychological importance).
* Military Situation: Considering the military capabilities from the different parties, the geography and the positioning (likely = possibly combined with observations - if available combined with rational reasoning), the Ukrainian forces are in a better position than the Russian forces. Some reasons are:
  * Movements over the two Dnieper bridges is observable and following the movement paths gives military locations away.
  * In view of the positioning of the different forces, the area is prone (very hard to defend against) to be shot by medium range maneuverable rockets for example launched by HIMARS. <!-- >> some reasons are: the area the missiles can be launched is large, the possible incoming angle is large, backtracing is hard as maneuverable)-->
  * The Dnieper crosses (two bridges and road crossing alongside dam) seem vulnerable to clever designed attacks (as of 27.7. the car bridge already needs to be repaired due to holes).
    > As of 29.8. all major bridges are reported to be (at least partly) demolished ([War Situation August](#war-situation-august)). // A complete destruction of the dam itself would have unwanted consequences. The dam forms the Kakhovka Reservoir (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakhovka_Reservoir>). The reservoir is important for the water provision for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, irrigation systems (including for the Crimea) and hydroelectric energy generation.






#### Kherson oblast *east of the Dnieper river:* 
Political and economical importance for Ukraine. Possibly, no 'NATO weapons' of [geopolitical] importance for Russia.


#### Speculations on Crimea

##### Opinion of the People of Crimea



##### Trading Rights
> Thoughts about the status of Crimea: An option could be that some territorial rights on Crimea are part of a trade. <!--possibly about 10 trillion UAH ~= 20 trillion Rubel ~= 350 billion $ though that's depending on many parameters such as the exact size and the rights sold. --> <!-- Assuming an area to buy of 27'000km2 = 27 * 10^9 m2, for square meter price of 100UAH=200Rubel=3.3$ its about 2700 billion UAH= 5400 billion Rubel = 90 billion $ or with a price of 300UAH=600Rubel=10$ per square meter about  8000 billion UAH = 16'000 billion Rubel = 270 billion $.--> 
> * Possibly (part of) the price could be paid with natural resources. // Many options by volume, absolute/relative throughput, limited/unlimited duration, different plans for the type of resource. 
> * Possibly only security/military rights could be Russian while some/all of the economic rights such as farming or natural resources are governed by Ukraine. <!-- Russia has enough other (and better) gas fields.-->
> * Taking into account the opinion of the people of the Crimea is considered nice.

>> According to public statements and a couple of personal discussions (not representative) Russians tend to be more emotional on the Crimea than  Ukrainians. A deal (involving economic topics, territorial and security rights) could have some acceptance in both governments and populations.

##### Exchanging Territory
> Another option would be to exchange territory e.g. trading some territory some Russian territory along the Russian-Ukrainian border (or some other territory) to Crimea <!-- another territory to consider is Kaliningrad Oblast, in some aspects the significance of Kaliningrad for Russia seems similar as the one of Crimea for Ukraine. Mainly put here as an example how difficult it can be to hand over territory.  -->. // Unlikely to happen. Giving up territory is likely not easy - even for Russia. Also Ukraine possibly prefers Crimea compared to other territory.

>>  To keep that in mind that handing over territorial rights is usually not easy.

> General thoughts about [trading territory](#trade-in-territory) in the appendix.

> Here, from a Swiss perspective, the current language situation/policy in Ukraine is considered - let's say - odd. 
>> In Switzerland there are three main languages, namely Italian (native speakers about 10%), French (native about 20%) and German (about 60%, though learned first and spoken is mainly a local alemannic dialect, collectively referred as Swiss German). Additionally Romansh is an official language and spoken by about 0.5%.

*Guterres underlines need for peace as Ukraine marks six months of ‘senseless war’*

Selected Statements:
* Guterres: 
  * “The people of Ukraine and beyond need peace and they need peace now,”
(https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2022-08-24/secretary-generals-remarks-
the-security-council-ukraine-delivered). ... “Peace in line with the UN Charter (https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter) . Peace in line with international law.”
  * “The warning lights are flashing,” ... “Any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant are simply unacceptable.  Any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction”. 
* DiCarlo stated the war is having another impact beyond the tragic human and material toll in Ukraine, and the consequences in other parts of the world. “In deepening global divisions and exacerbating mistrust in our institutions, the war is weakening the foundations of our international system," she said. “The consequences of a breakdown in how the world manages questions of peace and security are frightening to contemplate. This war is not only senseless, but exceedingly dangerous, and it touches all of us. It must end”.
* Zelenskyy warned that “Russia has put the world on the brink of radiation catastrophe”, referring to the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
* Nebenzya said while no one is arguing that it is ‘difficult” today for Ukrainians, “the responsibility for this lies with the Kyiv regime which came to power in 2014 as a result of an anti-constitutional coup carried out with the help of a number of Western states.” 









## Sanctions: Economic Measures

Economic Measures to Encourage Adherence to International Rules.

### Sanctions on Russia


#### Reasons for Sanctions



1. Encouraging Russia to stop offensive warfare and adhere to international rules such as the UN charter.
2. Once a truce is established, sanctions are considered adequate and suitable to encourage a fair solution and to implement it (e.g. a withdrawal of troupes). // hard to say what's a fair solution, here some speculations are in [Paths to Peace](#paths-to-peace)


> Subjective Reasons: Sanctions on Russia are considered adequate as:
> * the invasion and offensive warfare are not supported here ([Opinion on conflict](#opinion-on-the-conflict))
> * An alternative path to actions focussed mainly on the military. Economic restrictions are considered to have expected cost/benefits fare higher than warfare. 
>   * As the first also can have benefits respectively reduce risks (benefits such as cleaner air and reduce risks associated to the CO2 increase such as rising sea levels or ocean acidification). 
>   * While warfare has a variety of [bad effect associated](#significance-of-peace-and-effects-and-dangers-of-war) such as daily tragedies occurring which in turn divide people and conventional and nuclear environment pollution. // A bad relationship between Ukraine and Russia has the potential to destabilize Europe in coming decades including the risk of another war as these country likely will be [the] major military powers in Europe.

#### Overview
* *Sanction Target:* As a war is very expensive, the goal is to restrict the government income.
 
* *Situation:* 
  * The Russian state is largely financed by exports of petroleum products.
  * Petroleum products are: 
    * mobile, 
    * quite hard to track, 
    * consumption in rich countries tends to be price insensitive.

* *Goal:* Reduced the Russian state income. Lower the petroleum consumption to lower the prices and imports from Russia. Lower consumption and the prices as much as necessary e.g. down 60, 40, or even 20 $.
  > Although the Russia economy without petroleum has a lot of potential both with human and natural resources, a transition away from petroleum is a challenge. During a war is this hard. Without the income of petroleum and during a war this is very hard.
* *Implementation:* Some measures for consumption reduction of oil products are known from the oil price shocks in the 70s or from environment protection/global warming slowing measures. Even more strict measures are known from times of crises such as the first and second world wars when goods were scarce, one crisis fallback is rationing. 
  > Here in general, market based approaches are favored. Though a market based approach to reduce oil consumption of individuals works possibly to some extent in Slovakia or Iceland (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth>), however in most countries the wealth distribution is too skewed such that a 10 fold price increase will drive some to the edge of ruin, while not bothering others much, therefore a purely market based approach likely is considered neither fair nor efficient. Similarly at the country level.

#### Ground Transportation
* *Consumers:* Mainly private car and private and public airplane traffic. Reduce the consumption from individual traffic (when electricity is produced by gas/petroleum products electric cars are to be included). 
* *Measures:* Ideally some soft measures such as reduced consumption by promotion, by increase the attractiveness of public transport (such as the [9 Euro ticket](#buckley-for-cnn-on-9-euro-ticket)). If necessary stricter measures are possible:
  * Decreased Speed limits,
  * limit the usage of certain car types i.e. high fuel consumption cars unless usage has a rational necessity
  * increased taxes on fuel/car usage/road pricing  or rationing
  * tax car by weight (pointless 'weight race' as heavy cars mostly increase one owns security at the cost of decreasing the security of everybody else) possibly combined with road pricing.



#### Air traffic
* No short term and short duration air plane traffic. 
* Increased taxes/personal limits on airplane usage with a focus on short duration trips and first/business class travel.
* Restrict private airplane usage up to for strictly necessary usage.


#### Industry Consumption
Shutting down industries not strictly necessary which consume a lot of energy (directly or indirectly). Employees can be sent for further training (on more future proof techs) or a sabbatical (if wished/agreed). Postpone building projects.

### Sanctions on Members of the NATO and EU 

**in work and in consideration**

#### Reasons for Sanctions
* violation of OSCE rules by the manner of the NATO expansion
* violation of OSCE rules to some extent by the manner of the EU expansion. The EU has quite hard outer borders which can have 'curtain-like' effects for those on the outside and thereby decrease their ability to keep up people connections and friendships and thereby their security)
* inaction regarding encouragement for the MINSK agreement implementation. // Though on the plus side is was mediated.

> Subjective reason: When the cold war ended there was a discussion of a 'Common European home' (as described in [Savranskaya and Blanton](#savranskaya-and-blanton-2017)). The manner of the NATO/EU expansion *policy* with sidelining in aspects many of the former Soviet republics (including Russia) is not in agreement with that.


> #### 'Actors' from the 'West'
> The NATO countries sometimes act in concert and sometimes independent (which is considered a good thing in general) and sometimes in concert with the EU. Even within states different parties such as political parties or state organizations (such as the defense departments or secrecy services) can act differently and uncoordinated (see e.g. promises not expand the NATO eastwards as described in )  and state & private sponsored organizations have various degrees of freedom to act. Overall it can be difficult from the outside to judge who did/initiated/supported what, which and when. Accordingly to select members to be sanctioned is not [always]straight forward. // Often the US gets all 'the blame' [by countries opposed to the NATO] and considered to dominate the other members. Here the opinion/impression is that the US generally respects the sovereignty of other countries [at least as long as no vital US [security] interest are endangered - which are sometimes interpreted quite broadly]. So the US is just called for help [as a friendly sibling and not as a dominating one]. 
> In the decision process not only state associated actors but also private stack owners play a crucial role besides political parties. The broad decision finding with many discussions likely brings more stable and less errors, though it possibly takes a little more than as when small circles decide. 
> 
> Additionally for the US with the most mighty military on earth and therefore often in the unique position to intervene, decision making can be hard: Sometimes *a no* to intervene seems [to have been] wrong when looking backwards and sometimes *a yes* intervene seems wrong. From the second world war onwards the US tended to intervene more. // Here the opinion is, one should strengthen the UN to advocate human rights and prevent wars.

> Support of Ukraine to *defend* itself is *not* considered a reason for sanctions.
> > This should not be read as an advocation for a large numbers of offensive weapons. This page is pro peace and accordingly [offensive military](#military) [equipment] is in general (in the entire world) not advocated here - best would be if offensive weapons are reduced world wide] ([Worldwide Security](#security-in-europe-and-the-world)). Borders are advocated here to be redrawn, if at all, nearly always peacefully or if considered adequate with non-military measures, this even when the borders are considered unjust or against laws. // Some rare exceptions when military methods are not opposed: 
>>    * preventing further almost sure or already ongoing offensive warfare i.e. when the territories are 'clearly' illegally occupied and they are prepared or already as springboard for [ongoing] offensive warfare by the opponent.
>>    * preventing ongoing [systematic] violations of human right [on illegal occupied territories]
>>
>> but even in the exceptions above everything should be done to find a peaceful solution for example through diplomacy.

### Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
* Czechoslovakia’s Prague Spring of 1968 and Russia’s War against Ukraine, By Raymond Johnston. Published Aug. 27 at 10:53 am <https://www.kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/czechoslovakias-prague-spring-of-1968-and-russias-war-against-ukraine.html>


### Winter War
Background: Russia wanted the border to have further than 20 km away from St. Petersburg (then Leningrad) - what was referred by President Putin in 2013 as [correction border mistakes](#yle-on-putins-opinion-on-the-winter-war). The Finns were ready shift the border, but not as much as the Soviets demanded: The Soviets wanted to border to be moved that much for it to be closer to Viipuri (then Finland's second largest city) than the previous border was to St. Petersburg ([Background on Winter War](#wikipedia-on-the-background-of-the-winter-war) - which was likely viewed by the Finns in turn as introducing a 'border mistake'.

Warfare: The Finns cleverly used the homeland advantage such as knowing and using the terrain, prebuilt defensive structures and skills to live in winter conditions like skiing. The Finns received few extern support and fought mostly on their own. Without strong backing, for the Finns long-term warfare was hard to sustain with their economy, their lives, hampered by the war. The Soviets, with many fold more inhabitants and many of them living fare away from the front, could better sustain longer warfare. Though the losses of the Soviets were very high, so finally a peace treaty with concessions from the Finns (the Soviets had a huge resource advantage over the Finns) was reached, though keeping complete independence.

Post War: Both the Soviets and the Finns in the following respected the peace treaty and established good and friendly relations ([YLE](#yle-on-putins-opinion-on-the-winter-war)). // that the Winter War was perceived as defeat by the Soviets and the Soviets were much more powerful after they defeated the Nazis didn't change their adherence to the peace treaty as pointed out by [[Beck](#beck-on-the-winter-war)].

> In a climate of tension (the Finnish possibly knew about the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact from their British friends, while the Soviets knew about some closeness between Germany and Finland) to have population centers - such as the 2nd largest cities - not directly near foreign forces is understandably.

### Taiwan Territorial Situation
The situation of Taiwan has some similarities to the *part of* the Donbas that separated in 2014:
* Both separated after a revolution in the parent country yielding a separate administrative situation.
* Both are recognized by the UN as part of a parent country: Taiwan as part of People's Republic of China and the Donbas part as part of Ukraine.

// There are also many differences, which are not listed currently.

> A viable path possibly is:
> * A self-determined local government which has quite fare reaching autonomy for example choosing trade relations (practically mostly the case for Taiwan with the accepted WTO membership (<https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/chinese_taipei_e.htm>)). 
> * Keeping them out of geo/military-politics such as not to join military alliances (or foreign federations/countries), limits on offensive military - in other words the state of the United Nations is not be violated [from a geopolitical perspective]. 

>> Any kind of forcible methods against [the will of] the local population by *any* party are not considered adequate.

>> How to handle such situations and a clearer specification of self-determination is considered an important topic to be clarified internationally.

##### Summary Forsberg 05
Analysis of the NATO - Russia relation from 1991 to 2005. Selected statements:
* "NATO and Russia have several times declared the Cold War ended. The first occasion the Cold War was buried between the former enemies was in 1991, when NATO changed its strategic assessment and the Soviet Union joined the newly established North Atlantic Co-operation Council (NAC-C). It was also buried in 1997 when NATO and Russia signed a Founding Act of their mutual relations and decided to establish a NATO–Russia Permanent Joint Council (PJC). The last time they attended a Cold War funeral was in May 2002, when the parties decided to set up a NATO–Russia Council (NRC) that replaced the old PJC."
* "A New Start
How can we explain the new start in the NATO – Russia relationship? At least four factors that contributed to the improvement of the relationship after 1999 can be distinguished: Putin’s strategic realignment with the West, the Kursk submarine accident, the terrorist attacks of 11 September and the second post-Cold War enlargement of NATO."
* "Although Putin played a prominent role in the rapprochement between Russia and the West, restoring co-operation with NATO was supported by the majority of the foreign policy elite despite the trauma of the Kosovo war [28].
* "NATO is still perceived more often as an aggressive rather than a defensive pact, even among the supporters of Putin. The figures in public opinion polls measuring attitudes towards NATO have been changing only little and remain more negative than in 1997 [49]. As some analysts have noted, Putin’s new strategic partnership with the West rests on shaky domestic foundations. Therefore ‘the present day formation and feature of Russia’s go-West course may not be sustainable[50]. Senior people at the Russian armed forces, in particular, have not abandoned their views on NATO as a threatening military bloc aimed against Russia. A Russian defence ministry document released in October 2003, for example, indicated that Moscow will rethink its nuclear strategy if NATO continues to exist in its present form, fails to remove its ‘anti-Russian’ components and maintains its current ‘offensive’ doctrine[51]. While Putin has largely refrained from critical comments, Defence Minister Ivanov has often taken a more reserved view with regard to co-operation with NATO. Thus, at the Munich security conference in 2004 he demanded that Russia should have monitoring facilities at NATO bases to verify that they would pose no threat to Russia[52]. In March, just before the enlargement of the Alliance to the Baltic States, Ivanov repeated that NATO’s offensive doctrine, with anti-Russian attitudes inside NATO, would force Russia to adopt tougher defence measures."
* "It is true that ordinary Russians have a fairly negative attitude towards NATO: only a third think that Russia’s membership of the Alliance would be desirable. Yet, at the same time a majority of Russians would be ready to join ‘a military–political alliance together with European countries and the United States’."

Article 2, Paragraph 4: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations."




## Resources
Sites regularly consulted for articles and news. It is attempted to read a fairly broad array of resources and to take into the different viewpoints.

Ownership, key people and the mission are often stated [in work as of 27.7.]. The resources for the ownership are the "About" pages and wikipedia.

> The impression here is, that on important topics such as Ukraine-Russia-EU/NATO conflict is, what to write and/or what not to write is sometimes/frequently uniform for media conglomerates. Some newspapers encourage different viewpoints and the journalists have much freedom to write their own opinion while other streamline the narratives. Both freedom and constraints seem to occur for different ownership structures. State owned and single-person owned are most often associated to streamlined narratives while multiple shareholder owned news-sites tend to provide more freedom. Though single person owned and state owned sometimes also provide freedom to write.

## Appendix

### Opinion on the Conflict
> * Serious violations of human rights occur in most wars. This invasion is no exception: The human rights of the people of Ukraine are seriously violated. *War should never happen.*
> * The military actions and the following invasion are *not* in agreement with the UN charter, namely article 2 paragraph 4 of the [UN Charter](#un-charter) is violated. That other military conflicts (including military conflicts in 90s and 00s) were started not in agreement with international law, does not justify another break. Tensions between Russia and the NATO/EU are acknowledged but these are *neither* seen as a justification.
> * Brutality including bombing of specified civilian areas/hospitals or if civilians are hindered escaping is considered heartless.
    >> So fare *no systematic* targeting of civilians seems to occur. Tough civilians got hit on many occasions. *Each hit and death has people associated and thus is a tragedy on its own.*
> 
> For the main text, the conflict is taken as given and the focus is on pathways to peace that work/are acceptable for all sides, for that reason mostly a neutral/least common viewpoint is (tried to be) taken.




### Military
> [in work] 

> simplified and likely does often not reflect the situation on a real battlefield.

In defense it is possible to use buildings and natural structures as protection. For offense there are no protected defense positions, so usually action in the 'open field/air' is required at some point and thus a possible exposure to enemy fire. Solutions are to build equipment to avoid being targeted (e.g. by short exposure and/or stealth) or sustain a lot of damage (e.g. by heavy armor). 

Examples:
* Fast moving equipment (such as airplanes or self propelled artillery on fast vehicles) can be used for offense or defense. Though for offense some additional protection is usually wanted such as stealth or armor.
* Heavily armored tanks are typical offensive equipment. They can sustain quite a lot of damage but are not that well suited to be hidden within buildings.


Offensive equipment:
* heavily armored: tanks and self propelled artillery, 
* airplane bombers, 
* offensively used rockets (usually fairly large numbers are required)


Defensive equipment:

### Consideration on Territorial Rights and Integrity
[in work]




### Trade in Territory
'Considerations on territorial changes in a structured way.'

> Unfinished and in consideration/work.

> Trading territory is not considered ideal here, but better than an unilateral decisions (including unilateral referenda) and much better than military force.

Until the 19th century, land changing ownership by deals between countries or regions/cities buying themselves out from larger empires was practiced and accepted.

In todays world, that a region wants to secede but not both sides agree is a common challenge. 

> Territorial changes by unilateral referenda or by internal or external military force often causes instability and yielded many wars throughout history. Accepting unilateral territorial changes could set a 2022 precedent causing (increased) instability in the world.

The possibility of buying out at a 'fair' price could be an option when all parties agree - the involved countries and the local population (possibly with 60% or even a 2/3 majority). Buying/selling land may cause instability too, that's to consider. However if the prices are fair, stability is possibly retained. Between countries a territory exchange is another option (when the local populations agree).

> When private person can own, buy and sell land, why not countries or communities? 


### Self Determination

#### Paths for Self Determination
Here to achieve self-determination and living in a setting taking into account local peculiarities, a federalist government structure with local autonomy, fair and proportional participation in the senior state and respect for the local culture and language is favored over border changes/secession. 
Reasons are: 
* The world moves closer together:
  * Driven by improvements in communication and transportation, the cooperation between states increases. In support borders are becoming less strict. 
  * Technologies are more and more so powerful, world-wide effects are possible - overall for many challenges and risks in todays world, need a world wide cooperation to tackle them efficiently, so governance not always stops at borders.
* Multicultural countries have many benefits:
 * More efficient as the strengths of different cultures can be combined. 
 * Cultural spaces across countries increase interstate interactions and can help understanding & interstate friendships.
* *Peace.*
