## Board

### Human Rights
*We all - everyone - are granted with the same human rights*.


[Human Rights](#declaration-of-human-rights)



### Innocence of the People of Ukraine
There seems to be a consensus in belief that *the people of Ukraine are innocent*.



### Keeping Civilians out
Keeping civilians out of warfare is considered a common interest for *all* parties 1) to prevent suffering and losses and 2) in the long run to prevent to divide people and antagonistic thinking. Such effects can last long, especially when the suffering is high. With modern imaging (e.g. satellites/drones) pictures showing or hinting the brutality of war reach the world.

> Paths to escape, to reach a safe and in any way - including ethically - reasonable place are important. 




> ### Gorbachev on War
> "... When I became General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, I travelled to towns and villages across the country to meet people, to introduce myself and to talk. And there was one thing everyone talked about. They said to me: 'Mikhail Sergeyevich, whatever problems we may have, whatever food shortages, don't worry, we'll have enough food. We'll grow it. We'll manage. Just make sure there's no war.' I was stunned. That's how the people were. That's how much they had suffered in the last war. ..." from a [2019 BBC Interview](#gorbachev-bbc-interview-2019), translated by BBC.



### Diplomacy and Compromises
Diplomacy and Compromises from All Parties are likely the best Way out
* 'best' in the sense of - given the current situation - an optimal/least bad outcome considering *all* the people.
* An overall agreed fully just way out is likely very difficult to reach. 'Acceptable' just/unjust is possibly enough for peace, even long-term.



### Truce
A stop of all military actions are help to reduce the ongoing tragedies including losses, find paths to reduce the risks of escalation & peace and to bolster diplomacy. 

#### Reasons for a Truce
With the daily tragedies occurring and military analyses and decision required during a war, it can be hard to focus essential topics such as:
* Overall goals: Increasing security, good and peaceful relations with neighbors. Serving [the wishes of] all the people.
* Strengthen global security and make the world more peaceful - stopping military actions is a first step towards peace.
* Tackling the fundamental question of international law such as under which circumstances a region has the right for which degree of autonomy or even joining another country or alliance if such a right exists.
  > Self-determination including [regional] autonomy is ideally [clearer] specified (further considerations on the [Page on Universal Rights&Rules](../jurisprudence/universal_rights_and_rules.md)). Then autonomy questions for regions such as Scotland (how the UK allows Scotland to decide itself is considered exemplary.), Taiwan, Donbas, Kosovo, Basque County, Quebec, regions where natives live in the US, Canada, Australia and so on can be handled according to specified principles (the situations for named regions differ hugely, so possibly a set of principles is needed). In some cases a possible solution could be the right for a self determined local government with certain economic freedoms and possibly independent 'regional' sport teams e.g. for football (if wished, the UK shows it works. Though the gain of local identification and the chance to play seems to come at some cost in competitiveness).

> Here, the focus is on [searching paths to] peace and *not* on military topics. <!-- tactical/military discussions are challenging anyways to keep neutrality (unless [considered] useful for both)-->

> Negotiations, a true ceasefire and true and overall accepted peace, can get more difficult with further escalation. 



#### Ceasefire Implementation Option
> The opinion here is to obtain a ceasefire with few conditions: for both sides to agree the conditions likely need to be such that no side gets significant (tactical) advantages/disadvantages (this can involve freeze of the current situation such as a position freezes and stopping of non combat actions such as building up defenses or even material and troupe mobilization and/or movements outside of warfare areas). An accepted peace agreement - for which fairness, justice and overall acceptance is considered important - then can be found through negotiations. // When there is a broad international consensus what a [un]fair respectively [un]lawful situation is, the international community has leverage via sanctions to encourage a fair and lawful solution with [Sanctions](#sanctions-economic-measures).





### Considerations on military, diplomatic, economical and scientific Perspectives
After several months of war, further warfare may not improve negotiation positions of either site but cause unnecessary brutality and losses - including to civilians for example when trying to conquer foreign controlled cities and be associated to dangers of escalation.

From a military perspective, the Ukrainian defenders seem able to reconquer some territory. One reason is that in recently occupied territory the Russian defenses (often hastily built and improvised) have  weak points respectively sides (which are spotted by world-class intelligences) and the support from the local population is low, not there or adverse. However, how much actual territorial regains improve their negotiation position is unclear since both sides likely are aware of this capability and other points such as lessening of current and prevention of further sanctions, the overall security framework and restoration of relations with Ukraine and others (such as the US and European countries) are likely more important for Russia than territory.
Broad Russian advances are less likely since the Ukrainian defenses are strong: 3) Fortified positions and the light modern weapons are very well suited to defend fortified positions, 2) The Ukrainian soldiers are able to use them efficiently, which is not at all a matter of course: skill, courage, tactical cleverness and organization are necessary - and 1) they fight for and in their homeland which is a huge boost.

> Bloody battles can be spared for computer/console titles.

From prosperity and development perspective a stop of war seems crucial for both Ukraine and for Russia: if the war escalates or continues much longer an increased and possibly permanent (people tend to settle with time) exodus of skilled workers and the young generation is a risk - with possibly impeding their scientific and economic capabilities (and thereby also the military capabilities). Though when people tend to come back (i.e. such that there is no large population/brain drain) and keep friendships there are also chances.



### Considerations on the September Plebiscites
<!-- originally published 24.9. in updates, formulations adapted 12.10., moved here 23.11.-->

Plebiscites can be a chance when held & interpreted fairly and the results are handled in agreement with international law. 

In the current situation the interpretation of the results has its limits. When the question is whether people want to be with Russia:
* In territories occupied since February only a NO is meaningful: 
  * Voting Result YES: As many people who oppose Russia likely left and thus they can't participate and additionally people may not dare to vote 'NO' - especially when armed personal is present at the voting. => A YES is possibly due to people being afraid or away.
  * Voting Result NO: If people vote NO to closer ties with Russia, the message to the Russian soldiers is to go home.
* In the regions termed by the local administrations as People’s Republics of Donetsk (DNR) and Luhansk (LNR) the vote is possibly neither representative but wrong in both directions: While many people may have fled or feel pressured to vote yes, many strong supporters may be fighting and unable to vote. The vote in these regions thus is somewhat more meaningful.
  > * In case of a YES, to both respect international law and the people's opinion (in the sense of self determination) a possible solution could to keep DNR and LNR as autonomous regions in Ukraine but to enable the people close interactions with Russia (for example a custom union with Russia and free movement of people with Russia). In this case for the people of DNR and LNR would be part of the Ukraine and in most practical aspects also of Russia.
  * In the case of a NO, the message is to go.

> *The above notes may read as complete nonsense without any connection to reality.* Well possibly that's true. One reason they are put online nevertheless is, to argue that plebiscites are not per se unlawful even when there are territorial disputes. If everybody would be committed to peace and the right for self determination of the people from the Donbas (which they hardly had back since February 2014), meaningful plebiscites would be possible.

> Plebiscites are welcome here as long as they are free and handled lawfully in any aspects.




## Notes
The focus is on human rights [for individuals], many of which are violated in a war. Thus the page is *pro peace* and *against war*. A goal is to search for practicable [paths to peace](#paths-to-peace). For that reason to judge or point right/wrong doing is not the focus and it is attempted to take a neutral standpoint regarding states (personal viewpoint transparent in the [appendix](#appendix)).

* Global Organizations such as the United Nations, the IAEA, the WHO, Amnesty International and the Red Cross are considered important.

* Regularly consulted information sources are listed in [resources](#resources). Frequently consulted are the resources from Ukraine, Russia, Switzerland and UK.

* It is attempted to write always *factual & respectful & avoiding confrontation*, especially as this writing is public.
     > On the page on coronaviruses, sometimes the writing was emotional and/or even confrontational (written when stressed and/or influenced by the heated atmosphere) which was bad mistake and [possibly] even counterproductive. Sorry.

* Almost sure: Mistakes happen here and not all content is up to the task. 

* Feedback is welcome - especially pointing out mistakes and improvement suggestions.






## Paths to Peace

Consideration and searching for possible pathways to lasting peace.

### Security for Ukraine
* General [security considerations for Europe and the world](#security-in-europe-and-the-world) apply also to Ukraine as the largest country entirely within Europe.
* A strong technology and defense industry in Ukraine by international cooperation and support.
* A neutral status for Ukraine combined with (legally binding) security guarantees (the guarantees from the Budapest memorandum have not been enough). // officially in discussion



### Security for Russia
As Russia is a global power and the largest country of Europe, Asia and the world, the security of Russia is mainly considered in the context of [Security of Europe and the World](#security-in-europe-and-the-world). [in work]




### Security in Europe and the World

#### Security Architecture
Redesign of security architectures and designing/strengthening partnerships/cooperations/trust-building programs (e.g. the United Nations, the OSCE in Europe and [NATO trust building](#nato-trust-building) for example extending partnership for peace like cooperations).

#### Arms Control and Disarmament
* Demilitarized or at least no offensive weapons 
  * in striking distance of population centers. // Taken strictly this involves disarming strategic weapons.
  * alongside the borders of countries. // A natural such zone would be Russian-Ukrainian border as for the both countries strengthen their security is key.

* Increasing the Security by Limiting (Offensive) Military:
  * Reducing the number of offensive weapons. 
    > Weapons suitable for offense are usually mobile and/or heavily armored/stealth and/or have a long range such as rockets (including hypersonic rockets), airplanes (especially stealth airplanes and long-range bombers), armored vehicles (including tanks and armored self propelled artillery) and long-range (combat)drones.
  * Limits in exercises: 
    * the number of troupes in exercises.
    * limits for tests and exercises involving offensive weapons.

* Reducing Nuclear Weapons and their storage sites in Europe and around the world. "A withdrawal of all US/NATO nuclear weapons from Europe would have a constructive impact on international disarmament." (<https://cnduk.org/resources/united-states-nuclear-weapons-europe/>, 7.10.) 
<!--NATO’s nuclear deterrence policy and forces:<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50068.htm> --> 
<!-- increasing them has risks associated such as to increase tensions <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/poland-us-nuclear-wars-russia-putin-ukraine> -->



##### Refs Security and Disarmament
* <https://cnduk.org/> "CND campaigns non-violently to achieve British nuclear disarmament – to get rid of the Trident nuclear weapons system and stop its replacement. But we recognise that Britain’s nuclear weapons are only a small part of the problem, so we also campaign for a global nuclear weapons ban." from <https://cnduk.org/who/>, October 22




### NATO Trust building
> *in work and unfinished*

To increase the international trust respectively reduce distrust in NATO there are different options ranging from reforms to a re-founding/replacement, a dissolution or an integration into another organization such as the OSCE.

#### NATO Reforms/Reorientation
* Increase transparency. 
* Clearer (more purpose and actions defining) statutes and possibly a focus more on defense - in actions for example reducing offensive weapons. <!-- possibly only weapon exports to countries which adhere certain principles of humanity such as no death sentence, an overall fair legal system, local self determination for example by decentralization -->
* Open interstate cooperations to manage the challenges we face - the NATO expertise is broad.
* A focus on tasks such as crisis management and state-independent threats such as terrorism ([NATO counter Terrorism](#nato-counter-terrorism-reference-curriculum)).

##### Refs NATO Reforms
NATO Watch (<https://natowatch.org/about>)


#### NATO Rename/Refound/Replacement
A re-founding by a new, a fusion with/into an existing organization (e.g. OSCE). Already a renaming would emphasize reforms/reorientation and reduce/get rid of cold war associations. It is to acknowledge that the Cold War ended peacefully - as Havel put it: “It is a question of prestige. This is the reason why I talked about the new European security system without mentioning NATO. Because, if it grew out of NATO, it would have to be named something else, if only because of the element of prestige. ... But if NATO can transform itself – perhaps in conjunction with the Helsinki process – it would look like a peaceful process of change, not defeat.” from Document 12-2 in [Savranskaya and Blaton](#savranskaya-and-blanton-2017).


#### NATO Tasks and Background
The NATO, once was founded to contain the expansionist Soviet Union ruled under the horribly brutal [Stalinism](#thoughts-on-aspects-of-stalinism) (NATO: Founding treaty <https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67656.htm?>, Summer 22), developed into the most powerful military alliance on earth ever. The NATO frames (and today sees?) itself as a defensive alliance protecting democratic principles and human rights. Other states, including Russia, perceive the NATO differently.




> ##### NATO in the Yugoslavian Wars
> In early 90's is was not [officially] clear respectively stated what's the purpose of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and even if there still was any. NATO officials sometimes stated to become a more a political and less military organization. 
> 
> During the Yugoslavian Wars the NATO then was first ever involved as military party. The war was brutal including crimes such as ethnic cleansing from multiple parties. Postwar, the NATO and the EU incorporated the North-Western republics Slovenia and Croatia which happen to be the wealthiest and also mainly Roman Catholic. While the NATO framed itself as NACHO (North AdriatiC Human-rights Organization) and what the 'Western' media illuminated through the fog of war was accordingly (respectively the intelligence services released to the media). For others, the NATO possibly fought a proxy war and so the NATO possibly stood for something like Nationalistic Augmenting Threat Organization.
> > Looking from the outside and backwards it is hard to judge what really happened - who did what with which intentions at which point in time. One approach is focussing on the pre and post situation which avoids having to analyze foggy warfare, doing this - lets say - it seems possibly that the NATO respectively some of its member countries were *not* 'squeaky clean'.
> 
> Though the situation was complex and accordingly decision making. The region of former Yugoslavia had/has a complex history as most states have. There were nationalistic and/or separatist tendencies throughout the existence of the Yugoslavian state. Moreover in the 90's, previously granted minority rights and autonomy were (discussed to be) cut down.
> * Possibly increased/ensured autonomy could have avoided a war, possibly with help of the UN and clearer specified UN charter regarding autonomy rights.
> * The Open Balkans Project seems a viable path onwards. 
  >> Some reason are:
  >> * Immediate benefits for the local people such as free movement and student exchanges.
  >> * A partnership with the EU is more likely with a single well organized group instead of many small states. A better cooperation is important as the EU surrounds the Balkan and a full membership of the many small states seems unlikely as long as the EU has not reformed its decision processes and such a reform is not in sight.
  >> * The economies are working in larger markets which usually increases efficiency and competitiveness and [thereby] prepares the economies for an increased integration into the European and world-wide markets.

"""
FOREWORD

“With guns you can kill terrorists, with education you can kill terrorism.” — Malala Yousafzai, Pakistani activist for female education and Nobel Prize laureate

NATO’s counter-terrorism efforts have been at the forefront of three consecutive NATO Summits, including the recent 2019 Leaders’ Meeting in London, with the clear political imperative for the Alliance to address a persistent global threat that knows no border, nationality or religion.

NATO’s determination and solidarity in fighting the evolving challenge posed by terrorism has constantly increased since the Alliance invoked its collective defence clause for the first time in response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 on the United States of America.

NATO has gained much experience in countering terrorism from its missions and operations. However, NATO cannot defeat terrorism on its own. Fortunately, we do not stand alone. One of the strengths the Alliance can build on is our engagement with the global network of partner countries and other International Organizations who bring in a wealth of experience and knowledge. Many of these have contributed to the development of this reference curriculum, together with the Partnership for Peace Consortium of Defence Academies and Security Studies Institutes.

Understanding the terrorist threat of today and tomorrow requires not only improved awareness but constant learning and investment in the education of future generations. We sincerely hope that this curriculum will serve the wider counter-terrorism community as an insightful reference document and that it can contribute to national educational processes of both interested Allies and partners, including through NATO’s Defence Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP).

Dr. Antonio Missiroli, Dr. John Manza

##### NATO - Russia Tensions
There is a strong opposition from Russia to the expansion of NATO to its close neighbors, especially since the mid 90s. Possible reasons for this are: 
* From the Cold War, the NATO itself or at least the name carries ballast: "It is true that ordinary Russians have a fairly negative attitude towards NATO: only a third think that Russia’s membership of the Alliance would be desirable. Yet, at the same time a majority of Russians would be ready to join ‘a military–political alliance together with European countries and the United States’." as stated in [Forsberg 2005](#forsberg-05).
* The [NATO actions and interventions in the Yugoslavian Wars](#nato-in-the-yugoslavian-wars) were [perceived] aggressive and in violation with international laws (including the UN charter).
* The NATO was/is [perceived] anti Russian, which is official since the Madrid conference 2022 - though it practically always has been at least to some extent e.g. there have been/are constraint for countries to operate NATO and Russian military equipment alongside.







### Fluent European Borders
> in work

> Proposed and inspired by the calls from Ukraine and Russia for trilateral talks between Ukraine, the EU and the EEU (see for example [FT on the Vilnius Summit](#ft-on-the-vilnius-summit) respectively [Putin 2021](#vladimir-putin-on-the-historical-unity-of-russians-and-ukrainians)). // Instead of moving state-group borders between EU and the EEU, Ukraine associated to both (for example by double membership) and thus a bridge between them.

Ideally each two neighboring countries have friendly and close interactions to the extent that the borders between country become smooth/fluent. Ideally, when traveling from the British Isles to Türkiye and the Levant, from Scandinavia to the Maghreb or from Portugal to Russia all the borders are smooth.

As the major player and designer in Europe, the European Union has a key role but all European or bordering country groups such as the EEU, the CIS, the AU and the EFTA, are essential, as are all the countries themselves.

> A new political and economic organization with European countries and the Europe's neighbors as members could help.
> * Possibly the European Political Community proposed by France could be a suitable setting to discuss/establish smoother borders.
> * Possibly modelled similar to the [African Union](#african-union).

### Governance and Territorial Situations
#### Donbas
Autonomy (of varying degrees). Autonomy was a central part of the Minsk agreements (Minsk 1 and Minsk 2)
* unclear if the Minsk agreements are still a viable path.
* Taking into account the opinion of the people is considered nice, especially considering the events around the [2014 Revolution](#events-around-the-2014-kiev-revolution). 

> The impression here is: Ukrainians like to decide themselves. The people from the Donbas like to decide themselves whether, when and how to reintegrate. Close and good relations to Russia are of great importance for them.


#### Kherson oblast
##### Kherson oblast WEST of Dnieper including the city Kherson
Significance: Full (political, economic and security) control important for Ukraine. // As of 15.11. full Ukrainian control is restored.



<!-- 

// out of date, content planned to be moved/updated, 17.11.

On the Ukrainian military campaign: In the 2nd half of September (in the first half, there were many good reasons for pushing the forces away from Kharkiv such as bringing Kharkiv out of artillery range) mainly military objectives seem to guide: Fighting a grinding war or advance whichever is [considered] more advantageous. 
* Regarding Kherson city possibly mainly grinding [combined with slow advances], possibly waiting for the right moment and positioning or possibly patience until the supply breaks down to minimize losses as storming Kherson could be where bloody for all and cause a lot of destruction.
* Advances even into the Donbas, where it is - lets say - questionable whether the local people (i.e. the people living currently there) want fighting to return. 
  > Why not conquer [the hearts of] the people with charming policies instead of bombs?

* Military Situation: Considering the military capabilities from the different parties, the geography and the likely positioning (likely = possibly combined with observations (if available) & combined with rational reasoning), the Ukrainian forces are in a better position than the Russian forces. Some reasons are:
  * Movements over the two Dnieper bridges is observable and following the movement paths gives military locations away.
  * In view of the positioning of the different forces (peninsula like intrusion of Russian control into Ukrainian control), the area is prone (very hard to defend against) to be shot by different medium-range distance weapons such as medium range maneuverable rockets for example launched by HIMARS. // some reasons are: the launching area is large, the possible incoming angle is large, backtracing is hard as maneuverable)
  * The Dnieper crosses (two bridges and road crossing alongside dam) seem vulnerable to clever designed attacks (as of 27.7. the car bridge already needs to be repaired due to holes).
    > As of 29.8. all major bridges are reported to be (at least partly) demolished ([War Situation August](#war-situation-august)). // A complete destruction of the dam itself would have unwanted consequences. The dam forms the Kakhovka Reservoir (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakhovka_Reservoir>). The reservoir is important for the water provision for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, irrigation systems (including for the Crimea) and hydroelectric energy generation.
* Political Situation: The people in Kherson seem to want the Russian forces to go [most of all occupied areas].
-->

##### Kherson oblast EAST of the Dnieper river
Political and economical importance for Ukraine. Possibly, no offensive and/or [semi-]autonomous/remote controlled/able 'NATO weapons' of [geopolitical] importance for Russia.



#### Speculations on Crimea

##### Opinion of the People of Crimea
[coming]


##### Change of Territorial Rights


> General thoughts on [territorial rights](../jurisprudence/universal_rights_and_rules.md#territorial-rights).

###### Trading Some Territorial Rights
> Thoughts about the status of Crimea: An option could be that some territorial rights on Crimea are part of a trade. Possibly about 10 trillion UAH ~= 20 trillion Rubel ~= 350 billion $ though that's depending on many parameters such as the exact size and the rights sold.  
> <!-- Assuming an area to buy of 27'000km2 = 27 * 10^9 m2 with a price of 300UAH=600Rubel=10$ per square meter about  8000 billion UAH = 16'000 billion Rubel = 270 billion $.--> 
> * Possibly (part of) the price could be paid with natural resources. // Many options by volume, absolute/relative throughput, limited/unlimited duration, different plans for the type of resource. 
> * Possibly only security/military rights could be Russian while some/all of the economic rights such as farming or natural resources are governed by Ukraine. <!-- Russia has enough other (and better) gas fields.-->
> * Taking into account the opinion of the people of the Crimea is considered nice.

>> According to public statements and a couple of personal discussions (not representative) Russians tend to be more emotional on the Crimea than  Ukrainians. A deal (involving economic topics, territorial and security rights) could have some acceptance in both governments and populations.

###### Exchanging Territory
> Another option would be to exchange territory e.g. trading some territory some Russian territory along the Russian-Ukrainian border (or some other territory) to Crimea <!-- another territory to consider is Kaliningrad Oblast, in some aspects the significance of Kaliningrad for Russia seems similar as the one of Crimea for Ukraine. Mainly put here as an example how difficult it can be to hand over territory.  -->. // Unlikely to happen. Giving up territory is likely not easy - even for Russia. Also Ukraine possibly prefers Crimea compared to other territory.

>>  To keep that in mind that handing over territorial rights is usually not easy.



### Minority Rights in Ukraine

[in work]

#### Language Situation in Ukraine
* Wikipedia on the language policy in Ukraine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy_in_Ukraine>
* Parliament passes Ukrainian language bill <https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/parliament-passes-ukrainian-language-bill.html>

> Here, from a Swiss perspective, the current language situation/policy in Ukraine is considered - let's say - odd.

  > Considering that President Putin is responsible for actions of the Russian armed forces as the highest commanding authority (according to the Russian constitution as described in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia#Supreme_Commander-in-Chief>), possibly the path could be prepared by high profile members from Russia and Ukraine (possibly involving persons from the legislative or even the judicative).

## Historical and Political Background

### Events around the 2014 Revolution
[in work]
The 2014 revolution is also known as Euromaidan revolution or as revolution of dignity (as political opponents were treated without dignity beforehand ([Zadorozhnii 2016](#zadorozhnii-2016)).

> Updated, 5.11. Before, there was some bias influenced by early comments from a Donbas native, the comments surprisingly differed from the narrative told in 'Western' media including wikipedia (She pointed to the complex situation between west and east, especially for Donbas. The situation and especially the war was seen an immense tragedy.). Here, in the following there was some overshooting in classifying information as propaganda: For example the lack of dignity of how during the Yanukovych presidency political competitors were treated, wasn't given enough space. // Yanukovych's competitors, including Yulia Tymonshenko, had/have their voter bases mainly in the central and western regions of Ukraine.


// References Events around the 2014 Revolution
##### FT on the Vilnius Summit
*Tymoshenko warns Ukraine leader EU pact failure ‘biggest mistake’*, <https://www.ft.com/content/4ea48488-537c-11e3-b425-00144feabdc0>

> Selected statements:
> * In a letter written from Kachanivska penal colony, Ms Tymoshenko warned Viktor Yanukovich, the Ukrainian president and arch political rival, said a shift away from the EU and towards Russia would condemn Mr Yanukovich “to live all your life according to its diktats”.
> * “Don’t demand money so roughly and hysterically from the west in exchange for the agreement. It looks like Neanderthal manners,” Ms Tymoshenko wrote. “Sign the agreement and the west will give aid to you, just as it has every other European country that came into close association with the EU.”“to live all your life according to its diktats”.  // From a financial perspective the EU offer was less attractive than the Russian offer. Russian politics towards Ukraine can be [experienced as] dictating. However the IMF/EU requirements can be [experienced as] dictating too.
> * “Don’t allow your obsession with me to drive your policies,” she wrote. “I don’t know if they will listen to my appeal but I will do everything possible for the signing of the agreement even as I continue to sit in prison.”
> * “We have heard threats from our European partners towards Ukraine, up to and including promoting the holding of mass protests,” Mr Putin said at a press conference with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s prime minister. “This is pressure and this is blackmail. Whether Ukraine and the Ukrainian leadership will give in to such blackmail will be clear only in the next few days.” ''' // People protesting against a decision they don't like and which affects them is not extraordinarily when living in a free society, so the partners may have just spoken out of [unfriendly] personal experience at home. Violent protests are a different story - a difficult question is what turned them violent - external interference or internal reasons (e.g. aggressive suppression of peaceful protests, unlawful behavior towards oppositions politicians) or both?
> * "In place of bilateral talks with the EU, the Ukrainian government has suggested a “tripartite commission” between Kiev, Brussels and Moscow to resolve differences." // A reasonable proposal instead of just moving borders (or curtains), discussions on alternatives such as to eliminate them by smoothing them out ([Fluent Borders in Europe](#fluent-european-borders)).

> describes the handling of the Yanukovych government of political competitors/opponents and sheds light on the 2014 Revolution from this perspective: 
> * """The Revolution of Dignity was preceded by the events of 2010 to 2013 (the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych).2 The illegality of authorities' actions during this period could be qualified as a threat to the rule of law in Ukraine.""" from I. INTRODUCTION.
> * """Illegal arrests of activists with opposing views became one of the causes of the Revolution of Dignity. Moreover, the release of all political prisoners, including Tymoshenko, was one of the requirements of Maidan. Thus, the imprisonment of Tymoshenko proves that political persecutions are not only contrary to both national and international law; they can also provoke the protests of people. And, accordingly, such persecutions not only fail to achieve their goal to protect the regime but may have the opposite effect.""" from VII. CONCLUSION.

The Maidan Massacre in Ukraine: Revelations from Trials and Investigation, Ivan Katchanovski, School of Political Studies & Conflict Studies and Human Rights Program University of Ottawa, Canada ikatchan@uottawa.ca

> Some conclusions seem at least to have some truth such as "The revelations from the Maidan massacre trials and investigations show that the narratives promoted by the Ukrainian and Western governments and with some notable exceptions the media that the Maidan protesters were massacred by government snipers and/or the Berkut police are false.". While specific accusations are considered highly speculative such as "Such revelations from the Maidan massacre trials and investigations corroborate findings of the previous academic studies that this massacre was a false flag mass killing with involvement of elements of Maidan leadership and the far right and that it included the massacre of the police." For one, here it is considered unclear who actually had the leadership - the right wing? or were they just the thugs confronting the Berkut while the lead was at others? And second, the leadership of the protests - rough since the beginning but not deadly brutal - and those who give the order to shoot can be different people.

> * Ukraine focusses on the events in Crimea and argues that Russia took effective control of Crimea already ahead of the Referendum (32. and following). Who had control at which time points is relevant for the responsibility for human right abuses for which the case is at the ECtHR.

> Stalinism seems to have relied much to much on brutality and 'forced alliances', so the local willingness to cooperate was often missing and the system turned out to be not sustainable. It can even be doubted that the Warsaw Pact would have passed a serious stress test, especially after the crackdowns of protests in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Adverse feelings from the brutality of Stalinism such as deportations and ignorance of human rights seem to have been handed down the generations and last till today.

##### Summary Forsberg 05
Analysis of the NATO - Russia relation from 1991 to 2005. Selected statements:
* "NATO and Russia have several times declared the Cold War ended. The first occasion the Cold War was buried between the former enemies was in 1991, when NATO changed its strategic assessment and the Soviet Union joined the newly established North Atlantic Co-operation Council (NAC-C). It was also buried in 1997 when NATO and Russia signed a Founding Act of their mutual relations and decided to establish a NATO–Russia Permanent Joint Council (PJC). The last time they attended a Cold War funeral was in May 2002, when the parties decided to set up a NATO–Russia Council (NRC) that replaced the old PJC."
* "A New Start
How can we explain the new start in the NATO – Russia relationship? At least four factors that contributed to the improvement of the relationship after 1999 can be distinguished: Putin’s strategic realignment with the West, the Kursk submarine accident, the terrorist attacks of 11 September and the second post-Cold War enlargement of NATO."
* "Although Putin played a prominent role in the rapprochement between Russia and the West, restoring co-operation with NATO was supported by the majority of the foreign policy elite despite the trauma of the Kosovo war [28]."
* "NATO is still perceived more often as an aggressive rather than a defensive pact, even among the supporters of Putin. The figures in public opinion polls measuring attitudes towards NATO have been changing only little and remain more negative than in 1997 [49]. As some analysts have noted, Putin’s new strategic partnership with the West rests on shaky domestic foundations. Therefore ‘the present day formation and feature of Russia’s go-West course may not be sustainable[50]. Senior people at the Russian armed forces, in particular, have not abandoned their views on NATO as a threatening military bloc aimed against Russia. A Russian defence ministry document released in October 2003, for example, indicated that Moscow will rethink its nuclear strategy if NATO continues to exist in its present form, fails to remove its ‘anti-Russian’ components and maintains its current ‘offensive’ doctrine[51]. While Putin has largely refrained from critical comments, Defence Minister Ivanov has often taken a more reserved view with regard to co-operation with NATO. Thus, at the Munich security conference in 2004 he demanded that Russia should have monitoring facilities at NATO bases to verify that they would pose no threat to Russia[52]. In March, just before the enlargement of the Alliance to the Baltic States, Ivanov repeated that NATO’s offensive doctrine, with anti-Russian attitudes inside NATO, would force Russia to adopt tougher defence measures."
* "It is true that ordinary Russians have a fairly negative attitude towards NATO: only a third think that Russia’s membership of the Alliance would be desirable. Yet, at the same time a majority of Russians would be ready to join ‘a military–political alliance together with European countries and the United States’."

Selected Statements:
* Guterres: 
  * “The people of Ukraine and beyond need peace and they need peace now, ... Peace in line with the UN Charter (https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter). Peace in line with international law.” (<https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2022-08-24/secretary-generals-remarks-the-security-council-ukraine-delivered>).
  * “The warning lights are flashing,” ... “Any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant are simply unacceptable.  Any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction”. 
* DiCarlo stated the war is having another impact beyond the tragic human and material toll in Ukraine, and the consequences in other parts of the world. “In deepening global divisions and exacerbating mistrust in our institutions, the war is weakening the foundations of our international system," she said. “The consequences of a breakdown in how the world manages questions of peace and security are frightening to contemplate. This war is not only senseless, but exceedingly dangerous, and it touches all of us. It must end”.
* Zelenskyy warned that “Russia has put the world on the brink of radiation catastrophe”, referring to the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
* Nebenzya said while no one is arguing that it is ‘difficult” today for Ukrainians, “the responsibility for this lies with the Kyiv regime which came to power in 2014 as a result of an anti-constitutional coup carried out with the help of a number of Western states.”

A free economy: As the basis for everything, this means a powerful economy that develops itself freely without the negative influence of oligarchs and corruption, the pressure of inspection bodies and the tax office;
Development of the agriculture and digital economies: Food is always needed and the future is digital – let’s also not forget space;

Business support: We need maximum support for small and medium-sized businesses, simplification of the tax system, a transition from income tax to tax on turnover and on withdrawn capital, and severe financial penalties for non-payment;
Democracy, the further development of democratic institutions and a powerful middle class: These elements are key to a market-based, socially oriented economy, along with the transition from a parliamentary-presidential system to a purely parliamentary republic;
Reform: Completion of decentralization reform with the appropriate transfer of financial resources to localities; preservation of a rigid system of management in conditions of war; and the creation of a fair judicial system.

### Opinions by People from Russia

#### Vladimir Putin on the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians
Article by Vladimir Putin ”On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians“, July 12, 2021 17:00, <en.kremlin.ru/d/66181>


Selected statements:
* "I recall that long ago, well before 2014, the U.S. and EU countries systematically and consistently pushed Ukraine to curtail and limit economic cooperation with Russia. We, as the largest trade and economic partner of Ukraine, suggested discussing the emerging problems in the Ukraine-Russia-EU format. But every time we were told that Russia had nothing to do with it and that the issue concerned only the EU and Ukraine. De facto Western countries rejected Russia's repeated calls for dialogue."
* "The coup d'état and the subsequent actions of the Kiev authorities inevitably provoked confrontation and civil war. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates that the total number of victims in the conflict in Donbas has exceeded 13,000. Among them are the elderly and children. These are terrible, irreparable losses."
* "The incumbent authorities in Ukraine like to refer to Western experience, seeing it as a model to follow. Just have a look at how Austria and Germany, the USA and Canada live next to each other. Close in ethnic composition, culture, in fact sharing one language, they remain sovereign states with their own interests, with their own foreign policy. But this does not prevent them from the closest integration or allied relations. They have very conditional, transparent borders. And when crossing them the citizens feel at home. They create families, study, work, do business. Incidentally, so do millions of those born in Ukraine who now live in Russia. We see them as our own close people." // Transparent borders are supported here and discussed in [fluent borders](#fluent-european-borders) which is inspired by Russia's proposals for trilateral discussions between Ukraine, Russia and the EU - to make Ukraine a bridge building country.


> If the bombing of Ukraine continues [much longer] - regardless whether soldiers defending their homeland or civilian infrastructure are hit - the unity of Russians and Ukrainians will become historical in the sense that it becomes a thing related to the past (<https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/historical?q=historical>). // The other way round too, in the case of Donbas and Crimea [if bombs fall there].

> No judgement currently stated here whether the secession of Crimea is lawful, except that the current situation is considered unsatisfactory and a bilateral agreement through negotiations should be reached. Possibly by [trading some rights](./../jurisprudence/universal_rights.md#trade-in-territory), possibly as part of an [overall peace](#paths-to-peace). // Occupying territories or targeting infrastructure from Ukraine to get concessions from 3rd countries (NATO countries) - lets say - is considered not nice towards Ukraine.



> The literature below often contradicts each other and the arguments in the sparse literature differ a lot.

Peter, Örebech. "International law and Crimean secession from Ukraine (part 1)." Вестник Московского университета. Серия 27. Глобалистика и геополитика 4 (2020): 48-61. // pro Crimea secession

Selected statements: 
* "My position is that expressing its will in a referendum is no annexation. Western powers fail to document that Russia was in charge of an annexation of Crimea."
* "Summa summarum: lawfully elected members of VR escaped coup d’etat in Kyiv. MPs was in its full right to defend its position and to hit back on “destructive” political groups — i.a. “Svoboda”, “Batkivshina” and “Udar” [38] — several of which threatend democratic rule in case by moving from separatist appeals in direct violation of current Ukrainian constitution [50]."

> cites a couple of statements by the Crimean Verkhovna Rada which indicate strong disagreement of the Crimean Verkhovna Rada with the events leading to the [2014 revolution](#events-around-the-2014-revolution). This already before the February revolution which is when the Crimea police and not Russian troupes held power in Crimea. Regarding the legal aspects it argues pro unilateral secession, which is further argued in [part 2](oerebech-2020-part-2).



##### Oerebech 2020 Part 2
Peter, Örebech., INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CRIMEAN SECESSION FROM UKRAINE (part 2)*

Selected Statements:
* "Breaching the constitution and rejecting legitimate, legal power, i.e. the President to function according to basic laws of Ukraine, extra-parliamentary and undemocratic powers, ignored the people’s will expressed by the electorate. Direct power of people is the highest authority and thus in charge of the “People’s right to self-determination and self-government are part of its “residual rights”. Peoples sovereignty — residual rights — are applicable, as it happened in Norway 1814." // What if a region or some villages in Norway with a lot of oil and gas fields want secession?
* "Territorial integrity is a constitutional law principle effecting national states and its peoples’ inter pares or, as an International law principle, addressing two or more national states. There is no International law principle of territorial integrity that prohibits minority groups’ from orchestrating referenda and hereunder initiating and implementing the declaration of independence."

## Sanctions: Economic Measures

Economic Measures to Encourage Adherence to International Rules.



### Sanctions on Russia

#### Reasons for Sanctions

"So when you start counting pennies on your bank account or in your pocket, we do the same and count our casualties," - [Olena Zelenska in a interview for BBC](#zelenska-bbc-interview).

1. Encouraging Russia to stop offensive warfare and adhere to international rules such as the [UN charter](#un-charter). // The invasion ([Opinion on conflict](#opinion-on-the-conflict)) and offensive warfare in general are not supported here. 
2. Once a truce is established, sanctions are considered adequate and suitable to encourage a fair solution in agreement with international laws and covenants. // Hard to say what's an overall accepted and [ideally] fair solution - some proposals in [Paths to Peace](#paths-to-peace).


> Economic measures are seen as a better alternative to military actions as economic restrictions can be designed to have a much better benefits-costs ratio than warfare. Here, as such economic measures proposed a reduced usage of petroleum products. 
> * A reduction in petroleum products has benefits such as cleaner air and reduces risks associated to the CO2 increase such as rising sea levels or ocean acidification. 
> * Warfare on the other hand, has a variety of [bad effects and risks associated](#significance-of-peace-and-effects-and-dangers-of-war) such as daily tragedies occurring, dividing and brutalizing people and environment pollution in many ways. // A bad relationship between Ukraine and Russia has the potential to destabilize Europe in coming decades including the risk of another war as these country likely will be [the] major military powers in Europe.
>
> ##### Smooth Transition from Environmental Perspective makes Production Reduction Unlikely
> An aggressive production reduction to stabilize prizes by oil producing countries is considered unlikely: As this would encourage strict consumption reduction measures and thus a hard transition away from petroleum products (for the sake to reduce warfare) while from an environmental perspective a smooth transition away seems the reasonable path to go (important to have widespread support and no one is left sitting). // For example strict speed limits are not likely for environmental reasons alone, however, as the costs willing to take to prevent warfare are higher, strict limits may be an option as sanctions. Once the consumption is reduced a rebound is unlikely since it is [considered] the path to go anyways.
> > The OPEC+ productions reduction possibly has a (short-term) financial motivation and is a test and signal [for the 'West'].


#### Overview

* *Sanction Target:* As a war is very expensive, the goal is to restrict the government income.
 
* *Situation:* 
  * The Russian state is largely financed by exports of petroleum products.
  * Petroleum products are: 
    * mobile, 
    * quite hard to track, 
    * consumption in rich countries tends to be price insensitive.

* *Goal:* Reduced the Russian state income. Lower the petroleum consumption to lower the prices and imports from Russia. Lower consumption and the prices as much as necessary e.g. down 60, 40, or even 20 $.
  > Although the Russia economy without petroleum has a lot of potential both in skilled workers (e.g. strong in sciences such as Maths and Physics) and many natural resources other than petroleum, a transition away from petroleum is a challenge (other petroleum rich countries are better suited for solar plants, though Russia has gas which is considered best among fossils (very low air pollution and best among fossils regarding CO2) and thus at least near future proof). During a war is this hard. Without the income of petroleum and during a war this is very hard.

#### Implementation: Reducing Oil Price
Some measures for consumption reduction of oil products are known from the oil price shocks in the 70s or from environment protection/global warming slowing measures. Even more strict measures are known from times of crises such as the first and second world wars when goods were scarce, one crisis fallback is rationing. 
> Here in general, working and fair markets are considered suitable in many cases. However, to reduce the oil consumption of individuals, such an approach possibly works to some extent in Slovakia or Iceland, while in most countries the wealth distribution is too skewed (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth>) such that a 10 fold price increase will drive some to the edge of ruin, while not bothering others. Thus, a purely market based approach is considered neither fair nor efficient. Similarly at the country level.

##### Ground Transportation
* *Consumers:* Mainly private car and private and public airplane traffic. Reduce the consumption from individual traffic (when electricity is produced by gas/petroleum, electric cars are to be included). 
* *Measures:* Ideally some soft measures are sufficient to reduce consumption such as promotion or making public transport more attractive (an example is the [9 Euro ticket](#buckley-for-cnn-on-9-euro-ticket)). If necessary stricter measures are possible:
  * Decreased Speed limits,
  * limit the usage of certain car types i.e. high fuel consumption cars unless usage has a rational necessity
  * increased taxes on fuel/car usage or road pricing or even rationing
  * tax/road-price cars by weight and/or consumption (pointless 'weight race' as heavy cars increase one owns security in some situations at the cost of decreasing the security of everybody else) 

##### Air traffic 
* Individual limits/increased taxes on airplane usage with a focus on short duration trips and first/business class travel.  Possibly even a ban on short term and short duration flights.
* Restrict private airplane usage up to for necessary/well motivated usage (e.g. by requiring a motivation letters).


##### Industry Consumption
Shutting/slowing down industries not strictly necessary which consume a lot of energy (directly or indirectly). Employees can be sent for further training (on more future proof techs) or a sabbatical (if wished/agreed). Postpone building projects.

### Sanctions on Members of the NATO

**in work and in consideration**

#### Reasons for Sanctions
* Violation of OSCE rules by the manner of the NATO expansion
* Violation of OSCE rules to some extent by the manner of the EU expansion. The EU has quite hard outer borders which can have 'curtain-like' effects for those on the outside (and thereby decrease their ability to keep up people connections and friendships and thereby their security)
* Inaction regarding encouragement or even possibly discouragement for the MINSK agreement implementation. // Though on the plus side it was mediated (if it was sincere - which seems the case by most though others may have opposed).



> Subjective reason: When the cold war ended there was a discussion of a 'Common European home' (as described in [Savranskaya and Blanton](#savranskaya-and-blanton-2017)). The manner of the NATO/EU expansion *policy* with sidelining in aspects many of the former Soviet republics (including Russia) is not in agreement with that.


> #### 'Actors' in the 'West'
> The NATO countries sometimes act in concert and sometimes independent. Sometimes the NATO and the EU act in concert. Even within states different parties such as political parties or state organizations (such as the defense departments or secrecy services) can act differently and uncoordinated (see e.g. promises not expand the NATO eastwards as described in [Savranskaya and Blanton](#savranskaya-and-blanton-2017)). Moreover there are also private actors direct or indirect via sponsored organizations or lobbying. The more decentralized the larger the freedom to act (decentralization is considered great though there should be clear responsibility and accountability e.g. promises by foreign minister should be accountable). Overall it can be difficult from the outside to judge who did/initiated/supported what, which and when. Accordingly to select members to be sanctioned is not [always]straight forward. // Often the US gets all 'the blame' [by countries opposed to the NATO] and considered to dominate the other members. Here the opinion/impression is that the US generally respects the sovereignty of other countries [at least as long as no vital US [security] interest are [perceived to be] endangered]. So the US can be just called for help [as a friendly sibling and not as a dominating one].
> 
> Additionally for the US with the most mighty military on earth and therefore often in the unique position to intervene, decision making can be hard: Sometimes *a no* to intervene seems [to have been] wrong when looking backwards and sometimes *a yes* intervene seems wrong. From the second world war onwards the US tended to intervene more. // Here the opinion is, one should strengthen the UN to advocate human rights and prevent wars.
> 
>> Independent actors are considered a good thing in general as long as accountability and responsibility is there.


> Support of Ukraine to *defend* itself is *not* considered a reason for sanctions.
> > This should not be read as an advocation for a large numbers of offensive weapons. This page is pro peace and accordingly [offensive military](#military) [equipment] is in general (in the entire world) not advocated - best would be if offensive weapons are reduced world wide] ([Worldwide Security](#security-in-europe-and-the-world)). Borders are advocated here to be redrawn, if at all, peacefully or if considered adequate with non-military measures, this even when the borders are considered unjust or against laws. // Some rare exceptions when military methods are not strictly opposed: 
>>    * preventing further almost sure or already ongoing offensive warfare i.e. when the territories are 'clearly' illegally occupied and they are prepared or already as springboard for [ongoing] offensive warfare by the opponent.
>>    * preventing ongoing [systematic] violations of human right [on illegal occupied territories]
>>
>> but even in the exceptions above everything should be done to find a peaceful solution for example through diplomacy.





#### Adequate Sanctions
[in work/consideration]
// not easy to get the sanctions neutral ...

### Winter War
Background: Russia wanted the border to have further than 20 km away from St. Petersburg (then Leningrad) - what was referred by President Putin in 2013 as [correction border mistakes](#yle-on-putins-opinion-on-the-winter-war). The Finns were ready shift the border, but not as much as the Soviets demanded: The Soviets wanted to border to be moved that much for it to be closer to Viipuri, then Finland's second largest city, than the previous border was to St. Petersburg ([Background on Winter War](#wikipedia-on-the-background-of-the-winter-war)) - which was likely viewed by the Finns in turn as introducing a 'border mistake'.

Warfare: The Finns cleverly used the homeland advantage such as knowing and using the terrain, prebuilt defensive structures and skills to live in winter conditions like skiing. The Finns received few extern support and fought mostly on their own. Without strong backing, for the Finns long-term warfare was hard to sustain with their economy, their lives, hampered by the war. The Soviets, with many fold more inhabitants and many of them living fare away from the front, could better sustain longer warfare. Though the losses of the Soviets were very high, so finally a peace treaty with concessions from the Finns (the Soviets had a huge resource advantage over the Finns) was reached. The Finns kept complete independence.

Post War: Both the Soviets/Russia (under all leaders) and the Finns in the following respected the peace treaty and established good and friendly relations ([YLE](#yle-on-putins-opinion-on-the-winter-war)). // that the Winter War was perceived as defeat by the Soviets and the Soviets were much more powerful after they defeated the Nazis didn't change their adherence to the peace treaty as pointed out in [[Beck](#beck-on-the-winter-war)].

> In a climate of tension (the Finnish possibly knew about the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact from their British friends, while the Soviets knew about some closeness between Germany and Finland) to have population centers - such as the 2nd largest cities - not directly near foreign forces is understandably.

### Taiwan Territorial Situation



The situation of Taiwan has some similarities to the *part of* the Donbas that separated in 2014:
* Both separated after a revolution in the parent country yielding a separate administrative situation.
* Both are recognized by the UN as part of a parent country: Taiwan as part of People's Republic of China and the Donbas part as part of Ukraine.

// There are also many differences, which are not listed currently.

> A viable path for Taiwan possibly is:
> * A self-determined local government which has quite fare reaching autonomy for example choosing trade relations (practically mostly the case for Taiwan with the accepted WTO membership (<https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/chinese_taipei_e.htm>)). 
> * Keeping Taiwan out of geo/military-politics such as not to join military alliances (or foreign federations/countries), limits on offensive military - in other words the state of the United Nations is respected [from a geopolitical/military/security perspective - the UN is a *security*/[geo]political organization and not an economic one]. 

>> Any kind of forcible methods against [the will of] the local population by *any* party are not considered adequate.

>> How to handle such situations and a clearer specification of self-determination is considered an important topic to be clarified internationally.

## Resources
Sites regularly consulted for articles and news. It is attempted to read a fairly broad array of resources and to take into the different viewpoints.

Ownership, key people and the mission are often stated [in work as of 27.7.]. The resources for the ownership are the "About" pages and wikipedia.

> The impression here is, that on important topics such as Ukraine-Russia-EU/NATO conflict is, what to write and/or what not to write is sometimes/frequently uniform for media conglomerates. Some newspapers encourage different viewpoints and the journalists have much freedom to write their own opinion while other streamline the narratives. Both freedom and constraints seem to occur for different ownership structures. State owned and single-person owned are most often associated to streamlined narratives while multiple shareholder owned news-sites tend to provide more freedom. Though single person owned and state owned sometimes also provide freedom to write.

## Appendix

### Opinion on the Conflict
> * Serious violations of human rights occur in most wars. This invasion is no exception: The human rights of the people of Ukraine are seriously violated. *War should never happen.*
> * The military actions and the following invasion are *not* in agreement with the UN charter, namely article 2 paragraph 4 of the [UN Charter](#un-charter) is violated. That other military conflicts (including military conflicts in 90s and 00s) were started not in agreement with international law, does not justify another break. Tensions between Russia and the NATO/EU are acknowledged but these are *neither* seen as a justification.
> * Brutality including bombing of specified civilian areas/hospitals or if civilians are hindered escaping is considered heartless.
    >> So fare *no systematic* targeting of civilians seems to occur. Tough civilians got hit on many occasions. Each hit and death violates the personal integrity of a person and causes pain to the victim and the people associated.
    
*Regardless whether soldier or civilian, each hit and death is a tragedy on its own.*
