> ### Gorbachev on War
> "When I became General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, I traveled to towns and villages across the country to meet people, to introduce myself and to talk. And there was one thing everyone talked about. They said to me: 'Mikhail Sergeyevich, whatever problems we may have, whatever food shortages, don't worry, we'll have enough food. We'll grow it. We'll manage. Just make sure there's no war.' I was stunned. That's how the people were. That's how much they had suffered in the last war." from a [2019 BBC Interview](#gorbachev-bbc-interview-2019), translated by BBC.

### Cease-Fire

A ceasefire and stop of all military actions are important to bolster diplomacy and to prevent further escalation and losses. 

#### Reasons for a Ceasefire
> With the daily tragedies occurring and military analyses and decision required during a war, it can be hard to focus on essential topics such as: 
> * Strengthen global security and make the world more peaceful - stopping military actions is a first step towards peace.
> * Tackling the fundamental question of international law such as under which circumstances a region has the right for which degree of autonomy or even joining another country or alliance if such a right exists. // Here the opinion is that regional autonomy is ideally specified in the UN charter. Then autonomy questions for regions such as Scotland (how the UK allows Scotland to decide itself is considered exemplary.
), Taiwan, Donbas, Kosovo, Basque County, regions where natives live in the US, Canada, Australia and so on can be handled according to specified principles (the situations for named regions differ hugely, so possibly a set of principles is needed). In some cases a possible solution could be the right for a self determined local government with certain economic freedoms and possibly independent 'regional' sport teams e.g. for football (if wished, the UK shows it works but it also seems to show some disadvantages in competitiveness).

> Negotiations, a true ceasefire and true and overall accepted peace, can get more difficult with further escalation. 


#### Ceasefire Implementation Option
> The opinion here is to obtain a ceasefire with few conditions: for both sides to agree the conditions likely need to be such that no side gets significant (tactical) advantages/disadvantages (this can involve freeze of the current situation such as a position freezes and stopping of non combat actions such as building up defenses or even material and troupe mobilization and/or movements outside of warfare areas). An accepted peace agreement - for which fairness, justice and overall acceptance is considered important - then can be found through negotiations.



### Diplomacy and Compromises
Diplomacy and Compromises from All Parties are likely the best Way out
* 'best' in the sense of - given the current situation - an optimal/least bad outcome considering *all* the people.
* An overall agreed fully just way out is likely very difficult to reach. 'Acceptable' just/unjust is possibly enough for peace, even long-term.




### Keeping Civilians out
Keeping civilians out of warfare should be a common interest for *all* parties 1) to prevent suffering and losses and 2) in the long run to prevent to divide people and antagonistic thinking. Such effects can last long, especially when the suffering is high. With modern imaging (e.g. satellites/drones) pictures showing or hinting the brutality of war reach the world. 
> 
Paths to escape, to reach a safe and in any way - including ethically - reasonable place should be open. 




### Considerations on military, diplomatic, economical and scientific Perspectives
After several months of war, further warfare may not improve negotiation positions of either site but cause unnecessary brutality and losses - including to civilians for example when trying to conquer foreign cities and be associated to dangers of escalation.

From a military perspective, the Ukrainian defenders seem able to reconquer some territory. One reason is that in recently occupied territory the Russian defenses are not (yet) strong and the support from the local population is low, not there or adverse. However, how much actual territorial regains improve their negotiation position is unclear since both sides likely are aware of this capability and other points such as lessening of current and prevention of further sanctions, the overall security framework and restoration of relations with the Ukraine and others (such as the US and European countries) are likely more important for Russia than territory.
Broad Russian advances are less likely since the Ukrainian defenses are strong (fortified positions, the light modern weapons are very well suited to defend these fortified positions - and the Ukrainian soldiers are able to use them efficiently, which is not at all a matter of course: skill, courage, tactical cleverness and organization are necessary - and they fight for and in their homeland which is a huge boost). 
<!--outdated --An exception is to take control of the few unconquered bunkers in the Azovstal steelworks. However here too, an improvement in negotiation position is unclear as fully encircled bunkers come close to a (self-run) prison and thus seem better for negotiations than many new deaths on both sides. // Limited attacks could be both tryouts for a storming or a proof of will and capability to push the negotiation position. -->

> Generally the opinion here is that bloody battles can be spared for computer/console titles.
 
From prosperity and development perspective a stop of war seems crucial for both the Ukraine and for Russia: if the war escalates or continues much longer an increased and possibly permanent (people tend to settle with time) exodus of skilled workers respectively of the young generation is expected - with possibly impeding their scientific and economic capabilities (and thereby also the military capabilities) for a long time.








## Notes
The focus is on human rights for individuals, many of which are violated in a war, and thus to search for practicable [paths to peace](#paths-to-peace). 

For that reason to judge or point right/wrong doing is not the focus and it is attempted to take a neutral standpoint (personal viewpoint transparent in the [appendix](#appendix)).

* Global Organizations such as the United Nations, the IAEA, the WHO and the Red Cross are considered important.

* Information sources are listed in  [resources](#resources). Frequently consulted are The Guardian, MoscowTimes, Tass, KievPost

* It is attempted to write always *factual & respectful & avoiding confrontation*, especially as this writing is public.
     > On the page about coronaviruses, sometimes the writing was heated and confrontational (written when stressed and/or influenced by the heated atmosphere) which was bad mistake and possibly even counterproductive. Sorry.

* Likely/near sure: Mistakes happen here and not all content is up to the task. 

* Feedback is welcome - especially pointing out mistakes and improvement suggestions.










## Paths to Peace

### Security for Ukraine
* General [security considerations for Europe and the world](#security-in-europe-and-the-world) apply also to the Ukraine as the largest country entirely within Europe.
* A strong technology and defense industry in the Ukraine by international cooperation and support.
* A neutral status for the Ukraine combined with (legally binding) security guarantees (the guarantees from the Budapest memorandum have not been enough [clear]). // officially in discussion



### Security for Russia
As Russia is a global power and the largest country of Europe, Asia and the world, the security of Russia is mainly considered in the context of [Security of Europe and the World](#security-in-europe-and-the-world).



### Security in Europe and the World
* Demilitarized or at least no offensive weapons alongside the borders of countries. // A natural such zone would be Russian-Ukrainian border as for the both countries strengthen their security is key.
* Increasing the Security by Limiting (Offensive) Military:
  * Reducing the number of offensive weapons. 
    > As suitable weapons for offensive actions are usually mobile and/or heavily armored/stealth and/or have a long range such as rockets (including hypersonic rockets), airplanes (especially stealth airplanes and long-range bombers), armored vehicles (including tanks and armored self propelled artillery) and long-range (combat)drones.
  * Limits on exercises: 
    * the number of troupes in exercises.
    * Limit tests and exercises involving offensive weapons.
* Redesign of security architectures and designing/strengthening partnerships/cooperations/trust-building programs (e.g. the United Nations, the OSCE in Europe and extending partnership for peace like cooperations).




### NATO Trust building
> *in work and unfinished*

The increase the international trust into NATO there are options in a whole range: 
* reforms to increase transparency and clearer statutes
* a possible renaming 
* a re-founding or replacement by a new (possibly reusing many of the structures but [with statutes] focussing more on defending 'principles of humanity') or existing (e.g. OSCE) organization.


#### NATO Background
The NATO, once was founded to contain the expansionist Soviet Union ruled under the horribly brutal Stalinism, developed into the most powerful military alliance on earth ever. The NATO frames (and today sees?) itself as a defensive alliance protecting democratic principles and human rights. Other states, including Russia, perceive the NATO differently.

> Stalinism seems to have relied much to much on brutality and forced alliances, so the local willingness to cooperate was often missing and the system turned out to be not sustainable. It can even be doubted that the Warsaw Pact would have passed a serious stress test, especially after the crackdowns of protests in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Adverse feelings from the brutality of Stalinism such as deportations and ignorance of human rights seem to have been handed down the generations and last till today.


##### NATO - Russia Tensions
There is a strong opposition from Russia to the expansion of NATO to its close neighbors, especially since the mid 90s. Possible reasons for this are: 
* As a major player in the Cold War the NATO carries a lot of ballast, for example: 
  * "It is true that ordinary Russians have a fairly negative attitude towards NATO: only a third think that Russia’s membership of the Alliance would be desirable. Yet, at the same time a majority of Russians would be ready to join ‘a military–political alliance together with European countries and the United States’." as stated in [Forsberg 2005](#forsberg-05).
  * 
* The NATO actions and interventions in the Yugoslavian Wars were [perceived] aggressive and in violation with international laws (including the UN charter).
* The NATO was/is [perceived] anti Russian, which is official since the Madrid conference 2022 - though it practically always has been at least to some extent e.g. there are constraint for countries to operate NATO and Russian military equipment alongside).

> ##### NATO in the Yugoslavian Wars
> In early 90's is was not [officially] clear respectively stated what's the purpose of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and even if there still was any. NATO officials sometimes stated a more a political and less military organization. 
> 
> During the Yugoslavian Wars the NATO then was first ever involved as military party. The war was brutal including crimes such as ethnic cleansing from multiple parties. Postwar, the NATO and the EU incorporated the North-Western republics Slovenia and Croatia which happen to be the wealthiest and also happen to be mainly Roman Catholic. While the NATO then framed itself as North AdriatiC Human-rights Organization - what the 'Western' media (respectively the intelligence services released to the media) illuminated through the fog of war was accordingly. For others the NATO for more like a proxy war and so the NATO possibly stood for something like Nationalistic Augmenting Threat Organization. Looking from the outside and backwards it is hard to judge what really happened - who did what with which goals at which point in time. Though looking at the start and end state, the NATO seems not 'squeaky clean'.


> The region of former Yugoslavia had/has a complex history as most states have. There were Nationalistic and/or separatist tendencies throughout the existence of the Yugoslavian state. Moreover in the 90's, previously granted minority rights and autonomy were (discussed to be) cut down.
> * Possibly increased/ensured autonomy could have avoided a war, possibly with help of the UN and clearer specified UN charter regarding autonomy rights.
> * The Open Balkan Project seems a promising path for the future.




### Governance and Territorial Situations
#### Donbas
Autonomy (of varying degrees). Autonomy was a central part of the Minsk agreements (Minsk 1 and Minsk 2)
  > * currently unclear if the Minsk agreements are still a viable path.
  > * Taking into account the opinion of the people is considered nice, especially considering the events around Euromaidan. 
  > * The impression here is: Ukrainians like to decide themselves. The people from the Donbas like to decide themselves whether, when and how to reintegrate. Close and good relations to Russia are of great importance for them, this has to be taken into account.


#### Kherson oblast *west of Dnieper including the city Kherson*. 
Significance: Full (political, economic and security) control likely crucial for the Ukraine, likely even for a ceasefire. Since: 1) Nearly 300'000 people called the city of Kherson their home in 2021 and it is an important economical location for the Ukraine.  2) It could be used as a base for attacks on other cities west of the Dnieper (even as this seems to be not acute as of July 2022, for the people in South western Ukraine this is likely psychologically important).
* Military Situation: Considering the military capabilities from the different parties and the geography, the Ukrainian forces are in a better position than the Russian forces. Some reasons are:
  * Movements over the two Dnieper bridges is observable and following the movement paths gives military locations away.
  * In view of the positioning of the different forces, the area is prone (very hard to defend against) to be shot by medium range maneuverable rockets for example launched by HIMARS.
  * The Dnieper crosses (two bridges and road crossing alongside dam) seem vulnerable to clever designed attacks (as of 27.7. the car bridge already needs to be repaired due to holes).
    > As of 29.8. all major bridges are reported to be demolished ([War Situation August](#war-situation-august)). // A complete destruction of the dam itself would have unwanted consequences. The dam forms the Kakhovka Reservoir (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakhovka_Reservoir>). The reservoir is important for the water provision for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, irrigation systems (including for the Crimea) and hydroelectric energy generation.

#### Kherson oblast *east of the Dnieper river:* 
Political and economical importance for the Ukraine. Possibly, no 'NATO weapons' of [geopolitical] importance for Russia.


#### Speculations on Crimea
> Thoughts about the status of Crimea: An option could be that some territorial rights on Crimea are part of a trade. Handing over (some) rights on the Crimea could have some acceptance by both countries (governments and populations). <!--possibly about 10 trillion UAH ~= 20 trillion Rubel ~= 350 billion $ though that's depending on many parameters such as the exact size and the rights sold. --> <!-- Assuming an area to buy of 27'000km2 = 27 * 10^9 m2, for square meter price of 100UAH=200Rubel=3.3$ its about 2700 billion UAH= 5400 billion Rubel = 90 billion $ or with a price of 300UAH=600Rubel=10$ per square meter about  8000 billion UAH = 16'000 billion Rubel = 270 billion $.--> 
> * Possibly (part of) the price could be paid with natural resources. // Listing the countless possible schemes does not fit here as there many options by volume, absolute/relative throughput, limited/unlimited duration, different plans for the type of resource. 
> * Possibly only security/military rights could be Russian while some/all of the economic rights such as farming or natural resources are governed by the Ukraine. <!-- Russia has enough other (and better) gas fields.-->
> * Taking into account the opinion of the people of the Crimea is considered nice.

>> According to public statements and a couple of personal discussions (not representative) the emotional importance of the Crimea seems larger for Russians than for Ukrainians, therefore there could be support for a deal (involving economical and territorial rights and security) in both governments and populations.


> Another option would be to exchange territory e.g. trading some territory some Russian territory along the Russian-Ukrainian border (or some other territory) to Crimea <!-- another territory to consider is Kaliningrad Oblast, in some aspects the significance of Kaliningrad for Russia seems similar as the one of the Crimea for the Ukraine. Mainly put here as an example how difficult it can be to hand over territory.  -->. // Unlikely to happen. Giving up territory is likely not easy - even for Russia. Also the Ukraine possibly prefers Crimea compared to other territory.
>>  To keep that in mind that handing over territorial rights is usually not easy.
>
> General thoughts about [trading territory](#trade-in-territory) in the appendix.

* Parliament passes Ukrainian language bill <https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/parliament-passes-ukrainian-language-bill.html>

> Here, from a Swiss perspective, the current language situation/policy in the Ukraine is considered - let's say - odd. 
>> In Switzerland there are three main languages, namely Italian (native speakers about 10%), French (native about 20%) and German (about 60%, though learned first and spoken is mainly a local alemannic dialect, collectively referred as Swiss German). Additionally Romansh is an official language and spoken by about 0.5%.

#### Warfare in June
Intense warfare along the frontline very intense along the eastern frontline in the Donbas where Russia pushes/d to conquer Sievierodonetsk. Russian rockets still are fired at many targets of the Ukraine, civilian buildings are hit too (whether by mistake, because these building had military significance or on purpose is unclear). The defenders increasingly target ammunition depots and command posts behind the frontline.

*Guterres underlines need for peace as Ukraine marks six months of ‘senseless war’*
<https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/08/1125342>

Selected Statements:
* Guterres: 
  * “The people of Ukraine and beyond need peace and they need peace now,”
(https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2022-08-24/secretary-generals-remarks-
the-security-council-ukraine-delivered). ... “Peace in line with the UN Charter (https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter) . Peace in line with international law.”
  * “The warning lights are flashing,” ... “Any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant are simply unacceptable.  Any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction”. 
* DiCarlo stated the war is having another impact beyond the tragic human and material toll in Ukraine, and the consequences in other parts of the world. “In deepening global divisions and exacerbating mistrust in our institutions, the war is weakening the foundations of our international system," she said. “The consequences of a breakdown in how the world manages questions of peace and security are frightening to contemplate. This war is not only senseless, but exceedingly dangerous, and it touches all of us. It must end”.
* Zelenskyy warned that “Russia has put the world on the brink of radiation catastrophe”, referring to the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
* Nebenzya said while no one is arguing that it is ‘difficult” today for Ukrainians, “the responsibility for this lies with the Kyiv regime which came to power in 2014 as a result of an anti-constitutional coup carried out with the help of a number of Western states.” 









## Sanctions: Economic Measures

Economic Measures to Encourage Adherence to International Rules.

### Sanctions on Russia

> Reason - Sanctions on Russia are considered adequate to:
> 1. Encouraging Russia to stop offensive warfare and adhere to international rules such as the UN charter.
> 2. Once a truce is established, sanctions are considered adequate and suitable to encourage a fair solution (e.g. a withdrawal of troupes). // hard to say what's a fair solution, here some speculations are in [Paths to Peace](#paths-to-peace)

* *Sanction Target:* As a war is very expensive, the goal is to restrict the government income. 
* *Situation:* 
  * The Russian state is largely financed by exports of petroleum products.
  * Petroleum products are mobile and quite hard to track and further consumption in rich countries tends to be price insensitive.
* *Goal:* Reduced the Russian state income by lowering petroleum prices by lowering consumption. If wanted (by 'Western' countries alone), the prices can be lowered as much as necessary e.g. down 60, 40, 20 or even 10 $.
* *Implementation:* Some measures for consumption reduction of oil products are known from the oil price shocks in the 70s or from environment protection/global warming slowing measures. Even more strict measures are known from times of crises such as the first and second world wars when goods were scarce, a crises fallback is rationing. 
  > Here generally a market based approaches are favored. Though a market based approach to reduce oil consumption of individuals works possibly in Island (and possibly some other Nordic countries), in most countries the income distribution is much to skewed such that a 10 times price increase will ruin some while not bothering others much, therefore a purely market based approach likely is not that efficient and unfair.

  * Reduce the consumption from individual car traffic (as electricity is currently produced by gas/petroleum products electric cars are to be included). Ideally some soft measures such as encouraging consumption by promotion, by increase the attractiveness of public transport (such as the 9 Euro ticket). If necessary stricter measures from decreased speed limits up to rationing fuel/car usage are thinkable.
  <!--
    * Speed limits, rationing fuel, 
    * limit the usage of certain car types i.e. high fuel consumption cars unless usage has a rational necessity
    * increased taxes on fuel/car usage/road pricing 
    * tax car by weight (pointless 'weight race' as heavy cars mostly increase one owns security at the cost of decreasing the security of everybody else)
    * limit/rationing of car use in general
  -->
  * Reduce the consumption of air traffic. 
    * No short term and short duration air plane traffic. 
    * More strict measures would be rationing/tax airplane traffic.
  
  * Shutting down industries not strictly necessary which consume a lot of energy (directly or indirectly). Employees can be sent for further training (on more future proof techs) or a sabbatical (if wished).

<!--
### Sanctions on NATO Members

> The NATO countries sometimes act in concert and sometimes independent (which is considered a good thing in general). Additionally even within states different parties, state organizations (such as the defense departments or secrecy services) and state and private sponsored organizations have various degrees of freedom to act. Overall it can be difficult from the outside to judge who did/initiated/supported what, which and when. Accordingly to select members to be sanctioned is not (always) straight forward. // Often the US gets all 'the blame' [by countries opposed to the NATO] and considered to dominate the other members. Here the opinion/impression is that the US generally respects the sovereignty of other countries [at least as long as no vital US [security] interest are endangered - which are sometimes interpreted quite broadly]. So the US is just called for help [as a friendly sibling and not as a dominating one].

##### Summary Forsberg 05
Analysis of the NATO - Russia relation from 1991 to 2005. Selected statements:
* "NATO and Russia have several times declared the Cold War ended. The first occasion the Cold War was buried between the former enemies was in 1991, when NATO changed its strategic assessment and the Soviet Union joined the newly established North Atlantic Co-operation Council (NAC-C). It was also buried in 1997 when NATO and Russia signed a Founding Act of their mutual relations and decided to establish a NATO–Russia Permanent Joint Council (PJC). The last time they attended a Cold War funeral was in May 2002, when the parties decided to set up a NATO–Russia Council (NRC) that replaced the old PJC."
* "A New Start
How can we explain the new start in the NATO – Russia relationship? At least four factors that contributed to the improvement of the relationship after 1999 can be distinguished: Putin’s strategic realignment with the West, the Kursk submarine accident, the terrorist attacks of 11 September and the second post-Cold War enlargement of NATO."
* "Although Putin played a prominent role in the rapprochement between Russia and the West, restoring co-operation with NATO was supported by the majority of the foreign policy elite despite the trauma of the Kosovo war [28].
* "NATO is still perceived more often as an aggressive rather than a defensive pact, even among the supporters of Putin. The figures in public opinion polls measuring attitudes towards NATO have been changing only little and remain more negative than in 1997 [49]. As some analysts have noted, Putin’s new strategic partnership with the West rests on shaky domestic foundations. Therefore ‘the present day formation and feature of Russia’s go-West course may not be sustainable[50]. Senior people at the Russian armed forces, in particular, have not abandoned their views on NATO as a threatening military bloc aimed against Russia. A Russian defence ministry document released in October 2003, for example, indicated that Moscow will rethink its nuclear strategy if NATO continues to exist in its present form, fails to remove its ‘anti-Russian’ components and maintains its current ‘offensive’ doctrine[51]. While Putin has largely refrained from critical comments, Defence Minister Ivanov has often taken a more reserved view with regard to co-operation with NATO. Thus, at the Munich security conference in 2004 he demanded that Russia should have monitoring facilities at NATO bases to verify that they would pose no threat to Russia[52]. In March, just before the enlargement of the Alliance to the Baltic States, Ivanov repeated that NATO’s offensive doctrine, with anti-Russian attitudes inside NATO, would force Russia to adopt tougher defence measures."
* "It is true that ordinary Russians have a fairly negative attitude towards NATO: only a third think that Russia’s membership of the Alliance would be desirable. Yet, at the same time a majority of Russians would be ready to join ‘a military–political alliance together with European countries and the United States’."

Some newspapers encourage different viewpoints and the journalists have much freedom to write their own opinion while other streamline the narratives. Both freedom and constraints seem to occur for different ownership structures. State owned and single-person owned are most often associated to streamlined narratives while multiple shareholder owned news-sites tend to provide more freedom.

## Summaries




## Appendix

### Opinion on the Conflict
> The opinion/personal judgement is: 
> * Serious violations of human rights occur in most wars. This invasion is no exception: The human rights of the people of the Ukraine are seriously violated. *War should never happen.*
> * The military actions and the following invasion are *not* in agreement with the UN charter, namely article 2 paragraph 4 of the [UN Charter](#un-charter) is violated. That other military conflicts (including military conflicts in 90s and 00s) were started not in agreement with international law, does not justify another break. Tensions between Russia and the NATO/EU are acknowledged but these are *neither* seen as a justification.
> * Brutality including bombing of specified civilian areas/hospitals or if civilians are hindered escaping is considered heartless. 
    >> So fare *no systematic* targeting of civilians seems to occur. Tough civilians got hit on many occasions. *Each hit and death has people associated and thus is a tragedy on its own.*
> 
> For the main text, the conflict is taken as given and the focus is on pathways to peace that work/are acceptable for all sides, for that reason mostly a neutral/least common viewpoint is (tried to be) taken.





### Trade in Territory
'Considerations on territorial changes in a structured way.'

> Unfinished and in consideration/work.


Until the 19th century, land changing ownership by deals between countries or regions/cities buying themselves out from larger empires was practiced and accepted.

In todays world, that a region wants to secede but not both sides agree is a common challenge. 

> Territorial changes by unilateral referenda or by internal or external military force often causes instability and yielded many wars throughout history. Accepting unilateral territorial changes could set a 2022 precedent causing (increased) instability in the world.

The possibility of buying out at a 'fair' price could be an option when all parties agree - the involved countries and the local population (possibly with 60% or even a 2/3 majority). Buying/selling land may cause instability too, that's to consider. However if the prices are fair, stability is possibly retained. Between countries a territory exchange is another option (when the local populations agree).

> When private person can own, buy and sell land, why not countries or communities? 



> #### Preferred Path for Self Determination
> Here to achieve self-determination and living in a setting taking into account local peculiarities, a federalist government structure with local autonomy, fair and proportional participation in the senior state and respect for the local culture and language is favored over border changes/secession. 
> Reasons are: 
> * The world moves closer together:
>   * Driven by improvements in communication and transportation, the cooperation between states increases and borders are becoming less strict. 
>   * Technologies become so powerful effects on the whole world are possible - overall for many challenges and risks in todays world, need a world wide cooperation to tackle them efficiently, so governance not always stops at borders.
> * Multicultural countries have many benefits:
>   * More efficient as the strengths of different cultures can be combined. 
>   * Cultural spaces across countries increase interstate interactions and can help understanding & interstate friendships.
> * Peace.
