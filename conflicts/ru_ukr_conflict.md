## Board

### Situation Assessment per early May
Considerations on military, diplomatic, economical and scientific Perspectives

After more than 2 months of war, further warfare may not improve negotiation positions of either site but cause unnecessary brutality and losses - including to civilians for example when trying to conquer foreign cities which the Russian forces could try.

From a military perspective, the Ukrainian defenders seem able to reconquer some territory. One reason is that in recently occupied territory the Russian defenses are not (yet) strong and the support from the local population is low, not there or adverse. However, how much actual territorial regains improve their negotiation position is unclear since both sides likely are aware of this capability and other points such as lessening of current and prevention of further sanctions, the overall security framework and restoration of relations with the Ukraine and others (such as the US and European countries) are likely more important for Russia than territory.
Broad Russian advances are less likely since the Ukrainian defenses are strong (fortified positions, the light modern weapons are very well suited to defend these fortified positions - and the Ukrainian soldiers are able to use them efficiently, which is not at all a matter of course: skill, courage, tactical cleverness and organization are necessary - and they fight for and in their homeland which is a huge boost). An exception is to take control of the few unconquered bunkers in the Azovstal steelworks. However here too, an improvement in negotiation position is unclear as fully encircled bunkers come close to a (self-run) prison and thus seem better for negotiations than many new deaths on both sides. // Limited attacks could be both tryouts for a storming or a proof of will and capability to push the negotiation position. 
> This bloody battle can be spared for computer/console titles.
 
From prosperity and development perspective a stop of war seems crucial for both the Ukraine and for Russia: if the war escalates or continues much longer an increased and possibly permanent (people tend to settle with time) exodus of skilled workers respectively of the young generation is expected - with possibly impeding their scientific and economic capabilities (and thereby also the military capabilities) for a long time.



### Diplomacy and Compromises
Diplomacy and Compromises from All Parties are likely the best Way out
[in consideration/thinking]
* 'best' in the sense of - given the current situation - an optimal/least bad outcome considering *all* the people.
* An overall agreed fully just way out is likely very difficult to reach. 'Acceptable' just/unjust is possibly enough for peace, even long-term.

<!-- originally posted on the cov page-->


### Keeping Civilians out

Keeping civilians out of warfare should be a common interest for *all* parties 1) to prevent suffering and losses and 2) in the long run to prevent to divide people and antagonistic thinking. Such effects can last long, especially when the suffering is high. With modern imaging (e.g. satellites/drones) pictures showing or hinting the brutality of war reach the world. 
> 
Paths to escape, to reach a safe and in any way - including ethically - reasonable place should be open. 

<!--
 (originally posted on the cov page)

### Cease-Fire

A ceasefire and stop of all military actions are important to bolster diplomacy and to prevent further escalation and losses. Negotiations, a true ceasefire and true and overall accepted peace, can get more difficult with further escalation. 

> The opinion here is to obtain a ceasefire with few conditions: for both sides to agree the conditions likely need to be such that no side gets significant (tactical) advantages/disadvantages (this can involve freeze of the current situation such as a position freezes and stopping of non combat actions such as building up defenses or even material and troupe mobilization and/or movements outside of warfare areas). An accepted peace agreement - for which fairness, justice and overall acceptance is considered important - then can be found through negotiations.


> There seems to be a consensus in belief that *the people of the Ukraine are innocent*.
> <br>
> *We all - everyone - are endowed with the same human rights*.

## Notes
* The focus is on human rights for individuals - many of which are violated in a war - and to search for practicable [paths to peace](#paths-to-peace). For that reason to judge or point right/wrong doing is not the focus and it is attempted to take a neutral standpoint (personal viewpoint transparent in the [appendix](#appendix)).

* Global Organizations such as the United Nations and the Red Cross are considered important.

* Information sources are listed in  [resources](#resources). Frequently consulted are The Guardian, MoscowTimes, Tass

* It is attempted to write always *factual & respectful & avoiding confrontation*, especially as this writing is public.
     > On the page about coronaviruses, sometimes the writing was heated and confrontational (written when stressed and/or influenced by the heated atmosphere) which was bad mistake and possibly even counterproductive. Sorry.

* Likely/near sure: Mistakes happen here and not all content is up to the task. 

* Feedback is welcome - especially pointing out mistakes and improvement suggestions.




## Paths to Peace





### Security for Ukraine
* A neutral status for the Ukraine combined with (legally binding) security guarantees (the guarantees from the Budapest memorandum have not been enough [clear]). // officially in negotiation
* General [security considerations for Europe and the world](#security-in-europe-and-the-world) apply also to the Ukraine as the largest country entirely within Europe.


### Security for Russia
As Russia is a global power and the largest country of Europe, Asia and the world, the security of Russia is only discussed in the context of [Security of Europe and the World](#security-in-europe-and-the-world).


### Security in Europe and the World

* Increasing the Security by Limiting (Offensive) Military:
  * Reducing the number of offensive weapons such as rockets (including hypersonic rockets), airplanes (especially stealth airplanes and long-range bombers) and long-range (combat)drones.
  * Limits on exercises: 
    * the number of troupes in exercises.
    * Limit tests and exercises involving offensive weapons.
* Redesign of security architectures and partnerships/cooperations/trust-building programs (e.g. OSZE in Europe and extending partnership for peace).



### Governance and Territorial Situations
* Autonomy (of varying degrees) for Donbas // part of the Minsk agreement, currently unclear if the Minsk agreement is still a viable path
* status of Crimea: [Speculations on Crimea](#speculations-on-crimea)
* status of Kherson: Control likely crucial for the Ukraine.

#### Speculations on Crimea
> Thoughts about the status of Crimea: An option could be that some territorial rights on Crimea are part of a trade. Handing over (some) rights on the Crimea could have some acceptance by both countries (governments and populations). <!--possibly about 10 trillion UAH ~= 20 trillion Rubel ~= 350 billion $ though that's depending on many parameters such as the exact size and the rights sold. --> <!-- Assuming an area to buy of 27'000km2 = 27 * 10^9 m2, for square meter price of 100UAH=200Rubel=3.3$ its about 2700 billion UAH= 5400 billion Rubel = 90 billion $ or with a price of 300UAH=600Rubel=10$ per square meter about  8000 billion UAH = 16'000 billion Rubel = 270 billion $.--> 
> * Possibly (part of) the price could be paid with natural resources over the next years. 
> * Possibly only security/military rights could be traded while some/all of the economic rights such as farming or natural resources remain at/handed back to the Ukraine. // Russia has enough other (and better) gas fields.
> * According to public statements and a couple of personal discussions (not representative) the emotional importance of the Crimea seems larger for Russians than for Ukrainians.

> Another option would be to exchange territory e.g. trading Kaliningrad Oblast (or some territory along the border) to Crimea // Unlikely to happen. Giving up territory is likely not easy - even for Russia. Also the Ukraine possibly prefers Crimea compared to other territory.
>>  To keep that in mind that giving up territory is usually not easy.

> General thoughts about [trading territory](#trade-in-territory) in the appendix.

* Parliament passes Ukrainian language bill <https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/parliament-passes-ukrainian-language-bill.html>

> Here, out of a Swiss perspective, the current language legislation in the Ukraine is considered - let's say - odd. 
>> In Switzerland there are three main languages, namely Italian (native speakers about 10%), French (native about 20%) and German (about 60%, though learned first and spoken is mainly an alemannic dialect, collectively referred as Swiss German). Additionally Romansh is a national language spoken by about 0.5%.

* Prevent losses and suffering. War is brutal and human rights are violated.
* War can divide people.
* War can have risks associated and escalate.

## Appendix

### Opinion on the Conflict
> The opinion/personal judgement is: 
> * Serious violations of human rights occur in most wars. This invasion is no exception: The human rights of the people of the Ukraine are seriously violated. *War should never happen.*
> * The military actions and the following invasion are *not* in agreement with the UN charter, namely article 2 paragraph 4 of the [UN Charter](#un-charter). That other military conflicts (including military conflicts in 90s and 00s) were started not in agreement with international law, does not justify another break. Tensions between Russia and the NATO/EU are acknowledged but these are *neither* seen as a justification.
> * Brutality including bombing of specified civilian areas/hospitals or if civilians are hindered escaping is considered heartless. 
    >> So fare *no systematic* targeting of civilians seems to occur. Tough civilians got hit on many occasions. *Each hit and death has people associated and thus is a tragedy on its own.*
> 
> For the main text, the conflict is taken as given and the focus is on pathways to peace that work/are acceptable for all sides for that reason mostly a neutral/least common viewpoint is (tried to be) taken.





### Trade in Territory
'Considerations on territorial changes in a structured way.'

> Unfinished and in consideration/work.


Until the 19th century, land changing ownership by deals between countries or regions/cities buying themselves out from larger empires was practiced and accepted.

In todays world, that a region wants to secede but not both sides agree is a common challenge. 

> Territorial changes by unilateral referenda or by internal or external military force often causes instability and yielded many wars throughout history. Accepting unilateral territorial changes could set a 2022 precedent causing (increased) instability in the world.

The possibility of buying out at a 'fair' price could be an option when all parties agree - the involved countries and the local population (possibly with 60% or even a 2/3 majority). Buying/selling land may cause instability too, that's to consider. However if the prices are fair, stability is possibly retained. Between countries a territory exchange is another option (when the local populations agree).

> When private person can own, buy and sell land, why not countries or communities? 



> #### Preferred Path for Self Determination
> Here to achieve self-determination and living in a setting taking into account local peculiarities, a federalist government structure with local autonomy, fair and proportional participation in the senior state and respect for the local culture and language is favored over border changes/secession. 
> Reasons are: 
> * The world moves closer together:
>   * Driven by improvements in communication and transportation, the cooperation between states increases and borders are becoming less strict. 
>   * Technologies become so powerful effects on the whole world are possible - overall for many challenges and risks in todays world, need a world wide cooperation to tackle them efficiently, so governance not always stops at borders.
> * Multicultural countries have many benefits:
>   * More efficient as the strengths of different cultures can be combined. 
>   * Cultural spaces across countries increase interstate interactions and can help understanding & interstate friendships.
> * Peace.
