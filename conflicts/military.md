## Offensive and Defensive Equipment
### Principles of Offense and Defense
For offense at some point one needs to move towards the opponent. This requires moveability and usually moving while exposed to the opponent/enemy at some point. In defense, fixed defensive structures such as fortifications and natural structures can be used as protection. Such static defense structures usually provide a very high protection (usually much higher than achievable by mobile armor) and difficult to take out (for example fortified concrete or below the ground). This yields hallmarks of offensive and defensive equipment/weapons.

#### Hallmarks of Offensive Weapons
* *Capability for Movement while exposed to the Enemy.*
* *Capability to Take Out Defensive Structures.* 

<!--todo: possibly do as table with examples-->
#### Hallmarks of Defensive Weapons
* *Capability to take out Moving or Shooting Targets:*  Recognize, hit & render unusable.  
   * *Armor Piercing:* As offensive units usually need to move, their armor has trade-off between moveability and protection. This induces often some weak points in the armor which can be exploited. <!-- add Javelins or NLAW examples-->
   * *Counter Fire:* Detect & hit units firing.
* *Useable from Fortified Positions/fixed Installation.*


#### Solutions for movement in the 'open field'
* Avoid being targeted (e.g. by short exposure and/or stealth)
* Sustain a lot of damage (e.g. by heavy armor)
* Ignore destruction: unmanned and disposable equipment (e.g. rockets or loitering munition)
* Avoid movement: large range which avoids/reduces the movement necessary (e.g. rocket launchers, artillery). For example rocket launchers themselves even though they are part of an offensive system don't have to move in the open field, though the rockets/bullets have to move in open field.

In practice often a combination of protection is taken: Highly mobile equipment (such as airplanes or self propelled artillery on fast vehicles) can be used for offense or defense. Though for offense some additional protection is usually wanted such as stealth or armor.


### Classifying into Offensive and Defensive
By the hallmarks above equipment can be classified into offensive, defensive or mixed equipment. 

The classification just gives a tendency in usage but does not restrict it:
* Offensive Equipment able to destroy fixed structures can be used in defense for example to target the opponent supply routes.
* Armored offensive equipment can be used in defense, though it usually is not a resource efficient.
* 'Purely' offensive weapons need to be protected, for this defensive or mixed equipment in used.

> For offensive actions nearly always at least some offensive equipment is required and a flexible offensive force includes defensive or mixed equipment. For defense, defensive equipment is best suited.
 

#### Examples of Offensive Equipment
* Heavily armored tanks and self propelled artillery. They can sustain quite a lot of damage but are not well suited for use from fortified positions.
* airplane bombers, 
* offensively used rockets (usually fairly large numbers are required)
* Attack drones (possibly in swarms)

> To know all possibilities of the opponent offense is usually required to have a suitable counter for each timely at hand - which enables a reliable defense.


#### Mixed (offense/defense) equipment
##### Artillery
* *Self propelled:* 
  * Self propelled defined as fixed mounting to a moveable vehicle. 
  * Use case: Hit and run offense, quick reinforcement for defense. Well suited for terrain where the moveability [of the vehicle] is good (for example lots of path tracks)
* *Not-propelled:* Suitable for static front-lines and use from fortified positions and thus for defense or 2nd line offense.
* Infantry:
  * For offense: usually more heavily armored while maintaining the ability to move including the ability to move in settings with provide some stealth and/or cover: For example moving in wild terrain and/or at night, camouflage for different situations and terrains.
  * For defense: Shields and heavy guns to use from within fortified positions. Possibly tools to detect enemies by increasing the visibility field (as photo drones) or the visible wavelength such as infrared cams or radars.
