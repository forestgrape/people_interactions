## Offensive and Defensive Equipment
### Principles of Offense and Defense
For offense at some point one needs to move towards the opponent. This requires moving and usually at some point also moving while exposed to the opponent/enemy [fire]. In defense, fixed defensive structures such as fortifications and natural structures can be used as protection. Such static defense structures usually provide a very high protection which is usually much higher than any protection achievable by mobile armor.

#### Hallmarks of Offensive Weapons
* *Capability for Movement and Movement while exposed to the Enemy.* [Solutions for Movement while Enemy Exposed](#solutions-for-movement-while-enemy-exposed).
* *Capability to Take Out Defensive Structures.* Well built defensive structures are difficult to take out (for example fortified concrete and/or below the ground).

<!--possibly do as table with examples-->
#### Hallmarks of Defensive Weapons
* *Capability to take out Moving or Shooting Targets:*  Recognize, hit & render unusable.  
   * *Armor Piercing:* As offensive units usually need to move, their armor has trade-off between moveability and protection. Often then weak points in the armor which can be exploited. <!-- add Javelins or NLAW examples-->
   * *Counter Fire:* Detect & hit units firing.
* *Useable from Fortified Positions/fixed Installation.* Matching between equipment and fortification type helps, also when the fortifications have communication and surveillance tools.

#### Solutions for Movement while Enemy Exposed
* Avoid being targeted (e.g. by short exposure and/or reduce detection for example by stealth)
* Sustain a lot of damage (e.g. by heavy armor)
* Ignore destruction: unmanned and disposable equipment (e.g. rockets or attack drones/loitering munition)
* Avoid movement: Long range which avoids/reduces the movement necessary. For example artillery/rocket launchers themselves do not have to move much, though the rockets/bullets have to move in open field.
* Reduce exposure: For example by moving in terrain which provides cover or moving underground/water.
* Combined protections: While most mobile equipment (such as airplanes or self propelled artillery on fast vehicles) can be used for offense. For optimal offense, often some additional protection is added such as stealth or armor.


### Classifying into Offensive and Defensive
> in work

By the hallmarks above equipment can be classified into offensive, defensive or mixed equipment. 

The classification just gives a tendency in usage but does not restrict it:
* Offensive Equipment able to destroy fixed structures can be used for defense purposes for example to target the opponent supply routes. // Ukraine used HIMARS launched rockets in this respect effectively to defend itself in the [2022 invasion of Russia](ru_ukr_conflict.md).
* Armored offensive equipment can be used in defense, though it usually is not a resource efficient usage.
* When carrying out conquests, offensive equipment often needs to be protected, for this defensive or mixed equipment is needed.

=> For offensive actions nearly always at least some offensive equipment is required and a flexible offensive force includes defensive or mixed equipment. For defense, defensive equipment is best suited.
 

#### Examples of Offensive Equipment
* Heavily armored tanks and self propelled artillery. They can sustain quite a lot of damage but are not well suited for use from fortified positions.
* Airplane bombers.
* Offensively used rockets (usually fairly large numbers are required)
* Attack drones (possibly in swarms)

> To know all possibilities of the opponent offense helps to have a suitable counter for each timely at hand - which is needed for/enables a effective and reliable defense.


#### Mixed (offense/defense) equipment
##### Artillery
* *Self propelled (=fixed mounting to a moveable vehicle). Use case: Hit and run offense, quick reinforcement for defense. Well suited for terrain where its moveability is good (for many vehicles lots of path tracks mean good & flexible movement).
* *Not-propelled:* Use from fortified positions and thus strong for defense or 2nd line offense in rather static front-lines.

##### Infantry
* For offense: usually more heavily armored while maintaining the ability to move including the ability to move in settings with provide some stealth and/or cover. For example moving in wild terrain and/or at night, camouflage for different situations and terrains.
* For defense: Shields and heavy guns to use from fortified positions. Scouting/surveillance tools to detect enemies. For example increasing the visibility field (for example classic binoculars, photo drones or fixed installed camera traps) and/or the visible wavelength such as infrared cams or radars.
