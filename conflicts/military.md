In defense, fixed defensive structures such as fortifications and natural structures can be used as protection. This yields hallmarks of offensive and defensive equipment/weapons.

Hallmarks of Offensive Weapons:
* *Capability for Movement in the Open Field:* For offense, usually at some point action in the 'open field/air' is required and thus a possible exposure to enemy fire.
* *Capability to Take Out Defensive Structures:* When facing an opponent with defensive structures, these structures need to be handled.


Hallmarks of Defensive Weapons:
* *Capability to take out Moving Targets:*
* *Armor Piercing:*
* *Counter Fire:*

Solutions for movement in the 'open field':
* avoid being targeted (e.g. by short exposure and/or stealth)
* sustain a lot of damage (e.g. by heavy armor)
* unmanned and disposable equipment (e.g. rockets or loitering munition)
* large range (e.g. rockets)

Examples:
* Fast moving equipment (such as airplanes or self propelled artillery on fast vehicles) can be used for offense or defense. Though for offense some additional protection is usually wanted such as stealth or armor.
* Heavily armored tanks are typical offensive equipment. They can sustain quite a lot of damage but are not well suited to be hidden within buildings.


Offensive equipment:
* heavily armored: tanks and self propelled artillery, 
* airplane bombers, 
* offensively used rockets (usually fairly large numbers are required)
