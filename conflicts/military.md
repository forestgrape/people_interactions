In defense, fixed defensive structures such as fortifications and natural structures can be used as protection. Such static defense structures usually provide a very high protection (usually much higher than achievable by mobile armor). This yields hallmarks of offensive and defensive equipment/weapons.

Hallmarks of Offensive Weapons:
* *Capability for Movement in the Open Field:* For offense, usually at some point action in the 'open field/air' is required and thus a possible exposure to enemy fire.
* *Capability to Take Out Defensive Structures:* When facing an opponent with defensive structures, these structures need to be handled.


Hallmarks of Defensive Weapons:
<!-- possibly do as table with examples-->

* *Capability to take out Moving Targets:*  Recognize, hit & render unusable.  
* *Armor Piercing:* As offensive units usually need to be able to move, their armor has trade-off between moveability and protection. This induces often some weak points in the armor which can be exploited. <!-- add Javelins or NLAW examples-->
* *Counter Fire:* Detect & hit units firing.
* *Useable from Fortified Positions/fixed Installation:* 


Solutions for movement in the 'open field':
* avoid being targeted (e.g. by short exposure and/or stealth)
* sustain a lot of damage (e.g. by heavy armor)
* ignore destruction: unmanned and disposable equipment (e.g. rockets or loitering munition)
* avoid movement: large range which avoids/reduces the movement necessary (e.g. rocket launchers, artillery), though the rockets/bullets still have to move in open field.

Examples:
* Fast moving equipment (such as airplanes or self propelled artillery on fast vehicles) can be used for offense or defense. Though for offense some additional protection is usually wanted such as stealth or armor.
* Heavily armored tanks are typical offensive equipment. They can sustain quite a lot of damage but are not well suited to be hidden within buildings.


#### Offensive equipment
* heavily armored: tanks and self propelled artillery, 
* airplane bombers, 
* offensively used rockets (usually fairly large numbers are required)

> For a reliable defense is important to know all possibilities of the opponent offense capabilities, to have a counter for each timely at hand.

#### Mixed (offense/defense) equipment
* [self propelled] artillery // not-propelled usually better for use from fortified positions.
* Infantry:
  * For offense: usually more heavily armored while maintaining the ability to move, the ability to move in settings with provide some stealth/protections such as difficult terrain and/or at night, camouflage in different situations and terrain.
  * For defense: Shields and heavy guns to use from within fortified positions.
