## Offense and Defense

### Principles of Offense and Defense
Offense: 
For offense at some point one needs to move towards the opponent and usually in the opponent territory. This requires 1) movement, 2) movement in enemy territory and 3) usually at some point also actions (movement, shooting, demine, ...) while exposed to opponent/enemy attacks. The forces on the offense decide where and when to attack and thus where and when battles take place (whereby the opponent defenses constraints the locations). To find a good attack spot and time reconnaissance is important.

Defense: 
In defense, fixed defensive structures such as fortifications and natural structures can be used as protection. Such static defense structures usually provide a very high protection which is usually much higher than any protection achievable by mobile armor. In defense continuous surveillance enables to prepare for and react early to possible attacks and thereby take away surprise-effect advantage of the attacker.

#### Solutions for Opponent Exposure
* Mobility: Reduce the probability of being detected, targeted and/or hit (e.g. by short exposure and/or fast/irregular movement)
* Sustain Damage: Sustain a lot of damage (e.g. by heavy armor, stable construction)
  <!--there's usually a tradeoff between functionality and stability which puts limits on the stability given by the functionality. //One way to construct unstaffed demining vehicles should be to put the focus on stability. -->
* Disposable: Ignore destruction for example unmanned and disposable equipment such  as rockets or attack drones/loitering munition.
* Long Range: Long range which avoids/reduces the movement necessary/target closeness for the launchers, though the rockets still need to move to reach the target. For example artillery/rocket launchers themselves can be kept in at safe places and only the rockets/bullets have to move in open field.
* Cover providing Paths: Paths in terrain which provides cover or moving underground/water which reduces the probability for detection or hit.
* Camouflage: Classical camouflage for visible light or EM absorbing for radar stealth.
* Combined protections: While most mobile equipment (such as airplanes or self propelled artillery on fast vehicles) can be used for offense, a against a good defense usually some additional protection is added such as stealth or armor.



### Equipment by Defense and Offense
> in work

#### Hallmarks of Offensive Equipment
* *Capability for Movement, Movement in enemy territory and Movement while exposed to the Enemy .* [Solutions for Movement while Enemy Exposed](#solutions-for-opponent-exposure).
* *Capability to Take Out Defensive Structures.* Well built defensive structures are difficult to take out (for example fortified concrete and/or below the ground).
* *Reconnaissance.* Do reconnaissance or carry out actions based on it.

<!--possibly do as table with examples-->
#### Hallmarks of Defensive Equipment
* *Capability to take out Moving or Shooting Targets:*  Recognize, hit & render unusable.  
   * *Armor Piercing:* As offensive units usually need to move, their armor has trade-off between moveability and protection. 
   * *Target Achilles Heels: Often some not-so-strong spots remain which can be exploited by anti armor weapons. 
  <!-- for example Javelins or NLAW used by the Ukrainian forces, lancet drones and Vikhr missiles used by the Russian forces -->

   * *Counter Fire:* Detect & hit units firing.
* *Useable from Fortified Positions/fixed Installation.* Matching between equipment and fortification type helps, also when the fortifications have communication and surveillance tools.
* *Surveillance.* Surveil and/or respond to surveillance.

#### Remark
The hallmarks above, can be used to classify equipment into offensive, defensive or mixed equipment. However, the resulting classification just gives a tendency in usage but does not restrict it:
* Offensive Equipment able to destroy fixed structures can be used for defense purposes for example to target the opponents supply lines. // Ukraine used HIMARS launched rockets in 2022 to limit the offensive potential of the Russian forces when invaded in 2022.
* Armored offensive equipment can be used in defense, though it is usually not a resource efficient usage.
* When carrying out conquests and hold the positions, equipment with defensive capabilities is needed.

In conclusion, for offensive actions nearly always at least some offensive capabilities are required but a flexible offensive force includes equipment with defensive capabilities. For defense, defensive equipment is usually best suited.
 

#### Equipment for Offense
* Heavily armored tanks and self propelled artillery. Such equipment can sustain a lot of damage but are not well suited for use from fortified positions.
* Airplane bombers.
* Offensively used rockets (usually fairly large numbers are required)
* Attack drones (possibly in swarms)

> To know all possibilities of the opponent offense helps to have a suitable counter for each timely at hand - which is needed for/enables a effective and reliable defense.


#### Mixed Purpose Equipment
##### Artillery
* *Self propelled or easy moveable (=fixed mounting to a moveable vehicle). Use case: 1) Hit and run offense or defense (to avoid counter fire), 2) quick reinforcement for defense or overrun in offense i.e. bomb the opponent position . Well suited for terrain where its moveability is good (for many vehicles a good road network, respectively path network).
* *Fixed Position:* Use from fortified positions and thus strong for defense or offense in settings with rather static front-lines.

##### Infantry
* For offense: usually more heavily armored while maintaining the ability to move including the ability to move in settings with provide some stealth and/or cover. For example moving in wild terrain and/or at night, camouflage for different situations and terrains.
* For defense: Shields and heavy guns to use from fortified positions. Scouting/surveillance tools to detect enemies such as classic binoculars or electronic sensors. Tphoto drones or fixed installed camera traps and/or the visible.

##### Multipurpose Airplanes
Features:
* Fast (compared to other types of equipment)
* Terrain Independent
* while in air nearly only vulnerable to air defenses



#### Equipment for Defense
[in work]
* [Remote Equipment](#remote-equipment) is well suited for defense as it can be preinstalled and is ideal for surveillance.





## Types of Equipment
### Equipment by Manned and Unmanned
#### Unstaffed Equipment
Unmanned equipment can have different usages and be remote controlled and/or autonomous. 
Usage: for surveillance, reconnaissance, engineer or damage
Control Type: remote controlled or autonomous
Reusable: Onetime, Reusable

> Often damage equipment is remote controlled and *not* autonomous unless the target is predefined (e.g. the case for rockets) as one don't want machines to decide about damage especially lethal damage (mines and cluster mines are notable exceptions of autonomous remote damage equipment which have been around for decades with often devastating effects including for uninvolved people)<!--some drones in used in the Ukraine-Russo war are reported/seem to have target acquire capabilities by AI. td: cite-->.
> Often surveillance equipment has the ability for remote control as at least a one way data transmission has to be in place anyways and from a one way to two way transmission is mostly no [big] constraint.


<!--
Examples:
Purpose\Control Type  Remote controlled    | Autonomous  
Surveillance | remote vehicles, fixed install sensors | as data transmission is 
Damage        |  remote controlled weapons        | Mines
-->


#### Staffed Equipment
> in work [classically most vehicles is staffed such as airplanes, tanks, artillery, air defenses]


### Equipment by Purpose
> in work
#### Surveillance Equipment and Reconnaissance
##### Detection Range
Electromagnetic Waves:
* Widen and/or increase the visibility by binoculars/zoom-objectives and night vision. Cameras for different wavelengths: for example visible and infrared.
* Radars 

Physical Waves:
* In Air: microphones (for example drone detection)
* In the Ground: Seismograph 

##### Usage Type of Surveillance and Reconnaissance Equipment
> Most surveillance equipment can be used remotely either fixed or on unmanned vehicles (UAVs or UGVs). 
> > For surveillance equipment fixed installation is often suitable, especially if the cost of the surveillance equipment is much smaller than that of a vehicle and/or the equipment can be used from [prepared] covered or fortified locations.


#### Engineer Equipment
* Build structures such as fortifications and covers.
* Cross or remove physical obstacles such as rivers or mines.


#### Damage
Destroy or damage some opponent equipment.

#### Obstacles
* electric obstacles (for example by electronic warfare devices)
* physical obstacles/barriers: walls, trenches, moats, ...
