In defense, fixed defensive structures such as fortifications and natural structures can be used as protection. Such static defense structures usually provide a very high protection (usually much higher than achievable by mobile armor). This yields hallmarks of offensive and defensive equipment/weapons.

*Hallmarks of Offensive Weapons:*
* *Capability for Movement in the Open Field:* For offense, usually at some point action in the 'open field/air' is required and thus a possible exposure to enemy fire.
* *Capability to Take Out Defensive Structures:* When facing an opponent with defensive structures, these structures need to be handled which can be difficult as defensive structures can be built strongly (for example fortified concrete or below the ground)


<!--todo: possibly do as table with examples-->
*Hallmarks of Defensive Weapons:*
* *Capability to take out Moving or Shooting Targets:*  Recognize, hit & render unusable.  
   * *Armor Piercing:* As offensive units usually need to move, their armor has trade-off between moveability and protection. This induces often some weak points in the armor which can be exploited. <!-- add Javelins or NLAW examples-->
   * *Counter Fire:* Detect & hit units firing.

* *Useable from Fortified Positions/fixed Installation.* 


Solutions for movement in the 'open field':
* Avoid being targeted (e.g. by short exposure and/or stealth)
* Sustain a lot of damage (e.g. by heavy armor)
* Ignore destruction: unmanned and disposable equipment (e.g. rockets or loitering munition)
* Avoid movement: large range which avoids/reduces the movement necessary (e.g. rocket launchers, artillery). For example rocket launchers themselves even though they are part of an offensive system don't have to move in the open field, though the rockets/bullets have to move in open field.

Examples:
* Highly mobile equipment (such as airplanes or self propelled artillery on fast vehicles) can be used for offense or defense. Though for offense some additional protection is usually wanted such as stealth or armor.
* Heavily armored tanks are typical offensive equipment. They can sustain quite a lot of damage but are not well suited for use from fortified positions.


#### Offensive equipment
* heavily armored: tanks and self propelled artillery, 
* airplane bombers, 
* offensively used rockets (usually fairly large numbers are required)
* Attack drones (possibly in swarms)

> To know all possibilities of the opponent offense is usually required to have a suitable counter for each timely at hand - which enables a reliable defense.


#### Mixed (offense/defense) equipment
##### Artillery
* *Self propelled:* 
  * Self propelled defined as fixed mounting to a moveable vehicle. 
  * Use case: Hit and run offense, quick reinforcement for defense. Well suited for terrain where the moveability [of the vehicle] is good (for example lots of path tracks)
* *Not-propelled:* Suitable for static front-lines and use from fortified positions and thus for defense or 2nd line offense.
* Infantry:
  * For offense: usually more heavily armored while maintaining the ability to move including the ability to move in settings with provide some stealth and/or cover: For example moving in wild terrain and/or at night, camouflage for different situations and terrains.
  * For defense: Shields and heavy guns to use from within fortified positions. Possibly tools to detect enemies by increasing the visibility field (as photo drones) or the visible wavelength such as infrared cams or radars.
