### Summaries and Comments Legal Considerations and Actors
##### Summary Jakobsen
*EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE, FLORENCE ROBERT SCHUMAN CENTRE*

* """The German government remained almost indifferent to the crisis until domestic pressure had built up during the spring of 1991, and once the pressure had weakened due to the recognition in December, the government again adopted a low profile vis-à-vis Yugoslavia.27"""
   > Possibly this was theatre: The domestic pressure was built up by affiliated media (not necessarily limited to the German government) and the recognition has always been intended.

##### Summary Bagwell
*YUGOSLAVIAN CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS: SELF-DETERMINATION AND SECESSION OF MEMBER REPUBLICS*


43: In 1990, after suppressing several uprisings in Kosovo, Serbia annexed that province and the autonomous province of Vojvodina, thereby violating the Yugoslav Constitution. Bohlen, Serbian Voting, supra note 32, at A22. Many feel these extra-constitutional exploits by the Serbian government to forcibly integrate Kosovo and Vojvodina into Serbia started the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Aleksandra Kornhauser, ... 

105: Though he felt secession of a republic was unconstitutional, the vagueness of the right to secession prompted Mosa Pijade to state:
[A]lthough our Constitution has not guaranteed the right to secession, this does not mean that it is ruled out altogether. It is theoretically possible that some people or people's republic would bring up the matter of its secession. But that would be a thing to be solved in concerto [sic], either as a revolutionary or as a counter-revolutionary case, according to the situation.
HoNDIus, supra note 30, at 142-43.
It is interesting to note that many consider Mosa Pijade, the chief framer of the Yugoslav Constitution of 1946, as the Yugoslav equivalent of James Madison to the United States. Id. at 141. // Further statements by Mosa Pijade in 110

107: A document entitled "An initiative for a peaceful and democratic solution of the Yugoslav crisis and adoption of a new Yugoslav Constitution" was approved during the Belgrade meeting of top representatives of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia on August 14, 1991. This new initiative recognized that Yugoslavia must be preserved as a joint state of equal republics as nations. It based a new Constitution on the equality of the republics, and on free market economy guarantees. However, no explicit right of secession was mentioned in the new constitutional draft. [T]ripartite Meeting in Belgrade Issues Document on Yugoslavia's Future, BRIT. BROADCASTING CORP., Aug. 14, 1991, available in LEXIS, Nexis Library, Omni File.

110: Vlado Strugar, a colonel of the Yugoslav Army, expressed in a letter to Mosa Pijade in 1950 that:
The Communist Party of Yugoslavia has not excluded the idea of the right of peoples to self-determination and separation ... [b]ut this principle of mutual relations between our peoples cannot be applied today in the form of a right of separation, for our peoples have passed through this phase of development in the Revolution and by living together have entered into a joint State.
Hondius, supra note 30, at 142.
This view was confirmed by Mosa Pijade's response to Sturgar's letter:
Our Constitution contains no clauses which would give the republics the right of secession in the same sense as expressed for example by Article 17 of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R.
We do not wish to include such a provision into our Constitution for it would be insincere, as it is in fact in the Soviet Union. It would be not only insincere, but directly opposed to the historical origin and development of our federation. The latter has been established because our peoples, making use of the right to self-determination, 'to separate and unite with other peoples', did decide to live together in a common federal State and they have not used the right to secession, but the right to unite with others.
Inasfar as the Constitution has mentioned the right to secession, it is only in connection with the origin of the F.N.R.J. and not in order to ensure that our republics still have today the right of separation.
Id. at 142.
111: The boundaries dividing the republics from one another would provide for the destruction of the Federation if particular member-republics were to secede. For example, if Croatia decided to secede, Slovenia would be forced to follow as it would no longer have a border with the remaining republics of the Federation. If Serbia were to secede, Macedonia would have to follow as it would no longer have a border with other republics. If Bosnia-Herzegovina were to secede, the entire federation would be in turmoil as the other republics surround it." // seems to be a follow up to note 110 i.e. also by Mosa Pijade ?

115: The collective presidency also stated:
The Yugoslav state presidency considers that . . . the secession of the
republic of Slovenia from the S.F.R. of Yugoslavia . . . is an anti-constitutional act and one-sided action that attempts to impose on other Yugoslav republics through the policy of a fait accompli. The Yugoslav state presidency cannot agree nor accept anybody's one-sided action which violates the constitutional legal order and integrity of the country and its interests.


119: The right of secession and self-determination, according to the FEC, exists only through joint agreement of the republics and dictates a realistic time factor. This requires there be no interruption of the functioning of essential federal units whose dismantling would objectively lead to catastrophic economic, social, and political ends. Therefore, dissociation must not produce negative or harmful con-sequences for the interests of the other republics and Yugoslavia as a whole. See PremierAnteMarkovicPresentsGovernmentReportonCrisis,BRrr. BROADCASTING CORP., June 24, 1991, available in LEXIS, Nexis Library, Int'l File.

120: The FEC considers unilateral decisions of any kind on altering the external or internal borders of Yugoslavia to run counter to the peaceful and democratic solution of the crisis, and such acts are considered illegal and illegitimate. Furthermore, unilateral acts of secession would lead to the negation of democracy in the seceding areas through the use of coercive force. Id.

Secession as a unilateral act, the FEC maintains, would mean a violent change of current Yugoslav constitutional guarantees. [120] The FEC holds that if dissociation occurs as a simultaneous event, new relations between the remaining republics and the newly created nations must begin with the new modern multinational communities, such as those under way in Europe.[121] // text for the reference 120 at pages 510/511.

The paper has three chapters [A. Background](#a-background), [B. Declaration of Independence](#b-the-declaration-of-independence) and [C. Assessment](#c-assessment). Key statements of these three chapters are cited below.


##### A. Background
###### Historical and Geographical Situation
"""It is true for many international disputes that where one stands today depends from where one starts. This proposition has a particular salience in the Balkans. It is not possible in this short note on the events relating to Kosovo to start ‘at the beginning’, even if a beginning could be agreed upon;1 but one has to start somewhere. Since this is a cursory account and appraisal of the context of Kosovo’s Declaration of Independence,2 and because some States at least have called it the last act in the disintegration of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, I shall start with the beginning of that process and place the date simply somewhere in 1991. It is, though, necessary to say something about the present: Kosovo has been a part of what is now the State of Serbia. Its population of about 2 million people is ethnically distinct from that of the Serb majority in the State as a whole, being about 90 per cent ethnic-Albanian. The Serb population of Kosovo, about 200,000 people (5 per cent), has several locations in Kosovo but it is mainly concentrated in the north-east, north of the Ibar river and based on the city of Mitrovica. Kosovo is a place of great cultural significance to Serbia, in particular because of the location of sites of importance to the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo."""

###### On the Opinion of the Badinter Commission by the European Union
"""Among the entities which sought the Commission’s endorsement were Kosovo and the Serb Krajina in Croatia. The Commission would not entertain their applications, regarding a version of the rule of uti possidetis as binding its hands: these two were excluded because they were not Federal States of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY).""" 

> Krajina, a region in Croatia, is were widespread ethnic cleansing started in the Yugoslavian wars (carried out by troupes associated to Croatia [which were trained and usually advised by the US, though unclear how much].

###### On the Resolution 1244
"""
In its preamble, Resolution 1244 specifically reaffirmed: ‘The commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other States in the region, as set out in the Helsinki Final Act and Annex 2.’[16]
The substance of the long-term status of Kosovo was not addressed in Resolution 1244. Instead, among the functions of UNMIK were:
* (e) facilitating a political process designed to determine Kosovo’s future status, taking into account the Rambouillet Accords . . .
* (f) in a final stage, overseeing the transfer of authority from Kosovo’s provisional institutions to institutions established under a political settlement.
Both Russia and China emphasized the commitment to Yugoslavia’s territorial integrity in Resolution 1244 and it seems unlikely that they would have allowed the resolution to be adopted without such a provision.[17]
"""

##### B. The Declaration of Independence
###### On Kosovo's Declaration of Independence
* "Doubtless encouraged by indications that it would have the support of the United States and major EU States, the government of Kosovo took the initiative. On 17 February 2008, the Assembly of Kosovo issued its ‘Declaration of Independence’, in which it declared that the Republic of Kosovo was an ‘independent and sovereign State’."
* The final words of the declaration are cited "... We declare publicly that all States are entitled to rely upon this Declaration, and appeal to them to extend us their support and friendship." and commented with "A remarkable document, then—a unilateral declaration, erga omnes."

###### Euro-Atlantic Comments on the State Building in Kosovo
* Extract from Sweden recognition statement: "[It] recognizes the Republic of Kosovo as an independent State whose independence is supervised for the time being by the international community ... A difficult and demanding process is now being started to build a Kosovan State that meets international requirements.45" // As of 2023, Kosovo has come a long way back since 2008
* The US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs said on several occasions in a press conference that NATO troops were needed in the Republic of Kosovo to help it establish itself, pp 2 and 4, <www.state.gov/p/us/rm/2008/100976.htm> (18 February 2008). 

###### C. Assessment
The assessment starts:
"A common, though not universal, feature of the acts of recognition of the Republic of Kosovo was to say that Kosovo was ‘unique’ or ‘sui generis’, that its attainment of Statehood was not to be taken as a precedent which could be relied upon by any other ethnic group in a discrete territory which wished to secede from the State under the sovereignty of which it currently was and to have its own State. If it were to be a precedent (whatever that means),28 then the Statehood of the Republic of Kosovo could have a destabilizing effect on many States." 
and is closed:
"It would be convenient and very helpful if the international system had a legislative device to deal with anomalous cases, to be able to amend the general rules to accommodate them or to provide an expressly exceptional solution; but it does not, at least not in the absence of a Chapter VII Security Council resolution. All the invocation of the authority of ‘the international community’ cannot hide what is an attempt by some States, for what they see as very good reasons, to make a world which does justice to the Kosovars (and furthers their own interests in Balkan stability) even if that cannot be done without depriving Serbia of some of its rights. Nonetheless, international lawyers know only too well that the facts can make the law — and the facts in Kosovo will eventually establish whether or not Serbian authority is to continue or a new State has conclusively emerged — but at the moment, we are still waiting on the facts to be established. The law does not seem to have much to do with that."



## Appendix
### Looking Forward
European integration in the long run and possibly Open Balkans Project as a bridge seem a viable path onwards. 

> Some reason for Open Balkans [as a bridge]:
> * Deeper integration with the EU seems more likely with a single well organized group instead of many small states. A better cooperation is important as the EU surrounds the Balkan and a full membership may take time as the accession of many small states seems unlikely as long as the EU has not reformed its decision processes and such a reform is not immediate.
> * The economies can develope within a larger market which usually increases efficiency and competitiveness and [thereby] prepares the economies for the European and world-wide markets.
> * Benefits for people such as free movement and student exchanges.
