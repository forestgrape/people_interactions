## Board and Updates

> 12.10.23 (12.-24.10. adapted, originally published on the page [Ukr_Ru_in_Conflict](../ukr_ru_in_conflict/ukr_ru_in_conflict.md)): 
> The escalation of violence in Israel/Palestine is shocking and worrisome. The pictures and stories about the atrocious attacks by Hamas (which initiated the current escalation) are extremely appalling and distressful. No less appalling and distressful are the pictures and stories from Gaza due to attacks which flatten entire neighborhoods.
> 
> The statements from UN Secretary-General Guterres are agreed/shared: to end "the vicious cycle of bloodshed, hatred and polarization." (Middle East crisis: Guterres appeals for end to ‘vicious cycle of bloodshed, hatred and polarization’,<https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142082>).

> A cessation of violence is hoped for:
> * to reduce the risk of further escalation, 
> * to prevent ongoing tragedies - to provide safety for the people on both sides: the hostages should be let go home in everyone's interest, all civilians - especially all children - should have safe places and not be targets.
> * to ensure good or at least acceptable conditions for help, 
> * to analyse what happened, how & why it happened
> * to search & find near and midterm solutions for safety.
> * to search & find paths to lasting peace.
> * to avoid increasing the risk for future violence (e.g. Song, L. Y., Singer, M. I., & Anglin, T. M. (1998). Violence exposure and emotional trauma as contributors to adolescents' violent behaviors. Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine, 152(6), 531-536).

> > So many people in the region, so many innocent people from Palestine and Israel, have been exposed themselves or their nearest to so much violence already for a long time and/or for horrible kinds of violence with so many victims [not possible to reference it in full.
