## Considerations and Thoughts
##### Notes on the Escalation of Violence
12.10.23 (12.-24.10. adapted, originally published on the page [Ukr_Ru_in_Conflict](../ukr_ru_in_conflict/ukr_ru_in_conflict.md)): 
The escalation of violence in Israel/Palestine is shocking and worrisome. The pictures and stories about the atrocious attacks by Hamas (which initiated the current escalation) are extremely appalling and distressful. No less appalling and distressful are the pictures and stories from Gaza due to attacks which flatten entire neighborhoods.

The statements from UN Secretary-General Guterres are shared: to end "the vicious cycle of bloodshed, hatred and polarization." (Middle East crisis: Guterres appeals for end to ‘vicious cycle of bloodshed, hatred and polarization’,<https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142082>). 


A cessation of violence is hoped for:
* to reduce the risk of further escalation, 
* to prevent ongoing tragedies - to provide safety for the people on both sides: the hostages should be let go home in everyone's interest, all civilians - especially all children - should have safe places and not be targets.
* to ensure good or at least acceptable conditions for help, 
* to analyse what happened, how & why it happened
* to search & find near and midterm solutions for safety.
* to search & find paths to lasting peace.
* to avoid increasing the risk for future violence (e.g. Song, L. Y., Singer, M. I., & Anglin, T. M. (1998). Violence exposure and emotional trauma as contributors to adolescents' violent behaviors. Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine, 152(6), 531-536). 
      
> So many people in the region, so many innocent people from Palestine and Israel, have been exposed themselves or their nearest to so much violence already for a long time and/or for horrible kinds of violence with so many victims [not possible to reference it in full.

### Opinions from the Region

##### Egyptian Gazette citing from a Speech by Sisi
Sisi calls upon all parties to prioritise voice of reason, exercise self-restraint, Egypt seeks to stop conflict in Gaza, deliver aid to Palestinians, by Gazette Staff — October 13, 2023 in Egypt
<https://egyptian-gazette.com/egypt/sisi-calls-upon-all-parties-to-prioritise-voice-of-reason-exercise-self-restraint/>

'''
The President added that there are parties that seek to deviate the Palestinian cause from its peaceful course towards an escalation and zero-sum
conflicts, where there is no winner or loser.

“They want conflicts that violate the principles of international and humanitarian law and infringe upon the principles of religions and ethics,” the
President said.

“Every conflict that does not lead to peace is a waste of time,” Sisi said. “I call on all parties to raise the language of reason and wisdom, to commit to the utmost restraint, to remove civilians, children, and women from the circle of brutal revenge, and to return immediately to the path of negotiation.”

Sisi also said that Egypt is prepared to mediate between the parties, and that it will work with the international community to help bring about a
peaceful solution.

“I confirm in a clear way that Egypt’s pursuit of peace, and its consideration of it as a strategic option, requires it not to abandon its Palestinian
brothers, and to preserve the capabilities of the Palestinian people and to ensure their attainment of their legitimate rights,” Sisi said.
“This is our firm and unwavering position, and it is not a decision we take, but rather a belief that is embedded in our souls and consciences.”

###### CNN Interview with Rania of Jordan 24102023
Queen Rania of Jordan accuses West of ‘glaring double standard’ as the death toll rises in besieged Gaza, By Sana Noor Haq and Claire Calzonetti, 
Updated 10:12 AM EDT, Wed October 25, 2023
<https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/24/middleeast/queen-rania-jordan-amanpour-interview-intl> <!--also cited in The Guardian:<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/25/queen-rania-of-jordan-condemns-wests-silence-over-israeli-bombing-of-gaza>-->
* 'Rania said, “The people all around the Middle East, including in Jordan, we are just shocked and disappointed by the world’s reaction to this catastrophe that is unfolding. In the last couple of weeks, we have seen a glaring double standard in the world.”'
* '“Are we being told that it is wrong to kill a family, an entire family, at gunpoint, but it’s OK to shell them to death? I mean, there is a glaring double standard here,” she said. “It is just shocking to the Arab world.”'
* '''“Most networks are covering the story under the title of ‘Israel at war.’ But for many Palestinians on the other side of the separation wall, on the other side of the barbed wire, war has never left,” she said. 
“This is a 75-year-old story, a story of overwhelming death and displacement to the Palestinian people. It is a story of an occupation under apartheid regime, that occupies lands, that demolishes houses, confiscates lands, military incursions, night raids.”'''


###### Interview with Rania of Jordan 06112023
Jordan’s Queen Rania says being pro-Palestinian does not equal being ‘antisemitic’ <https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/middleeast/queen-rania-jordan-israel-gaza-interview-intl-hnk/index.html>. The interview is also cited on the personal website of Rania of Jordan: <https://www.queenrania.jo/en/media/press-releases/queen-rania-says-massive-palestinian-casualties-cannot-be-dismissed-human>

* '*“Let me be very, very clear. Being pro-Palestinian is not being antisemitic, being pro-Palestinian does not mean you’re pro-Hamas or pro-terrorism,”* Rania told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Sunday.' (text from CNN site)
* "If you manage to eliminate all of Hamas what next? The root cause of this conflict is an illegal occupation, it is routine human right abuses, illegal settlements, disregard to UN resolutions and international law. If we do not address these root causes, then you can kill the combatants but you cannot kill the cause." (transcribed from CNN video)
* *"When it comes to human shields, I think we need to defer to international law. Of course the use of human shields is criminal. But even if one side puts a civilian in harms way, that civilian is still entitled to full protection under international humanitarian law. That is the global standard and no nation is exempt."*  (transcribed from CNN video)
* “In a place like Jabaliya, which is one of the most crowded corners of Gaza – and Gaza being one of the most densely populated spots on Earth – civilian death is not incidental, it is not accidental. It is a foregone conclusion.” (Rania Al Abdullah official website, CNN video)
* '“We have had a long history of peaceful coexistence. So this is not about religion. It is about politics,” she said.' (Rania Al Abdullah official website)

##### Scott on Jews who Protest
OPINION LOCAL VOICE, Jews who protest against Israel are not your enemies, BY MARIYAMA SCOTT | NOVEMBER 17, 2023, <https://jweekly.com/2023/11/17/jews-who-protest-against-israel-are-not-your-enemies/>

Selected statements (emphasis added):

"""
The idea that the State of Israel represents all Jews. It does not. More Jews live in diaspora than in the State of Israel, and there have been anti-Zionist Jews for as long as Zionism itself has existed. The idea that Israel represents all Jews in fact makes Jews everywhere less safe — as we have already seen recently when people conflate the actions of Israel with the actions of theJewish people. And antisemites, most of them white nationalists, use this association to attack Jews who have nothing to do with the State of Israel.

The idea that Hamas represents all Palestinians. It does not. Even leaving aside the West Bank, where Hamas does not operate, there have been no elections in Gaza since 2006. Half the population of Gaza is children, most of whom weren’t even born in 2006. This idea also [is used to] justifies horrific treatment of Palestinians, leading to the bombing of refugee camps and assaults on hospitals.

*The idea that only one group — Palestinians or Jews — can be free in the land of Israel/Palestine. Freedom for one does not necessitate the removal of the other. Both peoples have reasons to fear genocide — but it is an inevitability for neither. It is possible for Palestinians and Jewish Israelis to live side by side in peace, as many peace organizations in the region have demonstrated over and over.*

*The idea that violence will solve this problem. It will not. If bombing Gaza could stop Hamas, it would already have worked in the Israel Defense Forces’ campaigns in 2008 or 2014. If killing Israelis is meant to end the occupation and persecution of Palestinians, it would already have worked after the first or second intifada. The idea that violence will solve this problem hardens our hearts to the human pain and suffering that is at the root of all violence.*
""" 

"""
*We do not have to choose between grief for Israelis and grief for Palestinians. We can feel for and honor both. Nor do we have to choose between our Jewish faith and our belief in the inherent worthiness of all human life. As Hillel said, “What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. This is the whole entire Torah; the rest is commentary. Go and learn.”*
"""




###### Harari on the World's Job
The World's Job During the War on Hamas: Save the Space For Peace, Ideas, October 16, 2023, 
<https://time.com/6324254/israel-hamas-war-peace-yuval-noah-harari/>

"""
Hamas’s crimes cannot be justified by blaming them on past Israeli conduct. Two wrongs don’t make a right. There is much to criticize Israel for holding millions of Palestinians for decades under occupation, and for abandoning in recent years any serious attempt to make peace with the Palestinian people.
"""

"""
... Most Israelis are psychologically incapable at this moment of empathizing with the Palestinians. The mind is filled to the brim with our own pain, and no space is left to even acknowledge the pain of others. Many of the people who tried to hold such a space—like the Kutz family—are dead or deeply traumatized. Most Palestinians are in an analogous situation—their minds too are so filled with pain, they cannot see our pain.
  
*But outsiders who are not themselves immersed in pain should make an effort to empathize with all suffering humans, rather than lazily seeing only part of the terrible reality. It is the job of outsiders to help maintain a space for peace. We deposit this peaceful space with you, because we cannot hold it right now. Take good care of it for us, so that one day, when the pain begins to heal, both Israelis and Palestinians might inhabit that space.*
