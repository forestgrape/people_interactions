Background: During the Persian Gulf War there was a threat for missile attacks in Tel Aviv, eventually 5 missiles hit densely populated areas in the Tel Aviv area and damage over 7000 houses. Upon alerts people moved to shelters. 

Methods: The authors analyze the effects on the behavior of 3, 4 and 5 year old children which either had there houses damaged and moved to hotels (displaced group), were exposed to a close by (10-500m) missile hit (un-displaced group = control group 1) or were only threatened (threatened group = control group 2).

Results: """Displaced children and mothers showed higher externalizing and stress symptom levels compared with undisplaced and threatened subjects. Destruction of the house and displacement, but not mere distance from the missile impact, explained symptomatic behavior.""" // externalizing/acting out behavior = aggression, delinquency, hyperactivity, and odd, immature, and unpopular behavior.
For 3 and 4 year-old displaced children their symptomatic behavior was associated to the mothers symptoms (Table 3) and to lacking affective bonds in the family (Table 4).

Last year we found in a random community sample of 1200 children aged between 7 and 15 that 1044 had been tear gassed, 852 had been subjected to night raids by soldiers on their homes, 624 had witnessed assaults on family members, 420 had been beaten, 228 had been detained, and 192 had been injured (including many with bullet wounds and broken limbs). Many had witnessed the army firing into school grounds and assaults in public on teachers and pupils; schools were also regularly shut by Israeli military authorities for indefinite periods. Our community surveys showed a high prevalence of nervousness, fears, restlessness, sleep disturbance,nocturnal enuresis,and psychosomatic symptoms among children. Teachers reported aggressive behaviour and reduced concentration and performance in the classroom.

In conflicts, however, children are not just passive victims but also active participants. Their identification with the intifada as a struggle for Palestinian identity seemed psychologically protective: we found that those who reported a willingness to confront soldiers, including many with a history of beatings, had higher self esteem than the others.
""" // that children are _active_ participants in this kind of conflicts is disagreed here, rather they usually just participants who go with flow; though they may become fighters later on.

Nadler et al. compare psychological characteristics from people jailed at least 12 months in Nazi concentration camps to people who didn't (mostly emigrated before to the Levant). Half of the respondents lived in a city and half in a Kibbutz.
Holocaust survivors showed mor signs of tension and insecurity and had lower emotional stability and boldness (Table 1). Survivors assigned greater value to their families. The results (both psychological and family importance) were more pronounced for people from cities than Kibbutzes.

Violence exposure of adolescents during the past year (mid 90s) at the research sites in the US:
* about 40% of male students reported being hit at school.
* about 75% from large city schools reported having witnessed someone being beaten up in school. 
* more than 45% from large cities reported having witnessed someone being shot at or shot.

Violent behavior within the past year:
From the male adolescents, about 50% had threatened someone with physical harm, more than half reported hitting someone before the other person hit them, and about 75% reported hitting someone after they had been hit, around 35% had beaten someone and about 20% reported having shot at someone. 
Regarding females, the variation tended to be larger. About 30% had threatened with physical harm, about 40% reported hitting someone before the other person hit them, about 60% reporting having hit someone after they had been hit. Shooting or knife attack tended to be less common for females.

Violence exposure alone explained about 25% of the violent behavior, trauma alone about 8% and the combined effect explained another 22% (Figure on page 535 in the paper). Anger was the trauma symptom most predictive for violent behavior. Regarding exposure, self exposure to shooting or knife attack was most predictive (Table 2 in the paper).
